# Chapter 8: Child in Danger

The ocean was trying to kill that child.

I could see it in the way the current pulled him—not gradually, but with vicious efficiency, dragging him away from shore faster than a child could possibly swim against. He surfaced once, arms flailing, mouth open in a scream I couldn't hear over the waves and my own pounding heart.

Then he went under again.

Matt and I swam with everything we had. I'd never swum this hard, this fast, this desperately. My arms burned. My lungs screamed. None of it mattered. There was only the water and the distance and the child somewhere ahead disappearing beneath the surface.

"I see him!" Matt shouted beside me. "Ten o'clock, thirty yards!"

I adjusted my angle. The current fought us, trying to push us off course, trying to tire us out before we reached him. I kicked harder, pulled faster, ignored my body's protests.

The child surfaced again, coughing water, struggling weakly. He was exhausted, drowning, running out of time.

Twenty yards. Fifteen.

"I'll get him!" I called to Matt. "You block the current!"

No discussion, no argument. Matt immediately shifted position, understanding instantly what I meant. He'd create a buffer against the strongest pull of the riptide while I secured the victim.

Ten yards. Five.

The child went under.

I dove.

The water was murky this far out, churned up by the current and yesterday's storm. I couldn't see clearly, just shapes and shadows and bubbles. I kicked down, scanning desperately.

There. A small form sinking, arms limp, no longer fighting.

I grabbed him and kicked hard for the surface. My lungs were bursting. The child was deadweight in my arms. Up, up, up—

We broke the surface together. The child wasn't breathing.

"Matt!" I screamed.

He was beside me instantly, treading water, assessing the situation with one look. "Get him on his back. I'll help support."

We worked in perfect synchronization, born of training and desperation and some instinct deeper than conscious thought. I shifted the child onto his back, tilting his head to open his airway. Matt positioned himself to help support the child's weight while I started rescue breathing—just like Captain Ed had drilled into us a hundred times.

One breath. Check for response.

The child's chest rose but he didn't cough, didn't move.

Two breaths.

"Come on," I whispered. "Come on, breathe."

Around us, the ocean continued its relentless pull. We were still far from shore, still caught in the current, but I couldn't think about that. There was only this child and getting air into his lungs.

Three breaths.

The child coughed. Water streamed from his mouth. He gasped, coughed again, and started crying—the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard.

"We've got you," I said, my voice shaking. "We've got you. You're safe."

"We need to move!" Matt's voice was urgent. "Current's pulling us further out!"

He was right. While we'd been focused on getting the child breathing, the riptide had dragged us even farther from shore. The beach looked impossibly distant.

"Can you swim parallel?" I asked Matt. "I'll keep the kid above water?"

"You can't swim and support him alone. Current's too strong." Matt's mind was clearly working through options at lightning speed. "We do it together. You secure him from behind, I take point position and pull. Use me as your anchor."

It wasn't standard technique—it was something we'd have to improvise—but I trusted him completely in that moment.

"Okay. On three?"

"One... two... three."

I shifted the child into a cross-chest carry, securing him against my body. Matt positioned himself perpendicular to us, providing a stable point I could hold onto while kicking. Together, we started the brutal swim parallel to shore, fighting to escape the riptide's strongest pull.

The child was crying, terrified but breathing. I held him tight, keeping his head above water, murmuring reassurances I wasn't sure he could hear.

"You're doing great," I told him. "Just hold on. We're getting you back to your mom."

Matt swam like a machine—powerful, steady, tireless. Every stroke pulled us closer to escaping the current's grip. My job was to hold the child and kick, adding what propulsion I could while Matt did the heavy work of breaking us free.

It felt like hours. It was probably three minutes.

"Current's easing!" Matt called back. "Angle toward shore now!"

I adjusted my position, kicking toward the beach. Matt changed his angle to match, and suddenly we were swimming with the waves instead of against them. Not easy, but possible.

The shore was still so far away.

My arms were shaking with exhaustion. The child was small but felt like he weighed a hundred pounds. My legs were cramping. Everything hurt.

"I can see Danny in the water!" Matt reported. "Backup's coming!"

I couldn't spare the energy to look. I just held the child and kicked and trusted that Matt knew where we were going.

Danny reached us first, cutting through the water with fresh strength. "I've got the kid!" he said, taking the child from me.

The sudden absence of weight was shocking. My arms felt strange without their burden.

"Josie, you okay?" Matt was beside me, his hand on my shoulder.

"Fine," I gasped. "Kid?"

"He's breathing. Danny's got him. We need to get you to shore."

"I can swim."

"Humor me."

Matt stayed beside me as we swam the remaining distance, not helping exactly, but ready to if I faltered. I was grateful for his presence even though I'd never admit it.

My feet touched sand and my legs nearly buckled. Matt caught my elbow, steadying me. Together we stumbled onto the beach where chaos had erupted.

The child's mother was screaming his name, reaching for him as Captain Ed and Linda worked on him. Danny had already started more thorough rescue breathing. The child was conscious, coughing up seawater, crying for his mother.

He was alive.

We'd done it.

My legs gave out and I sat down hard in the wet sand. Matt dropped beside me, both of us gasping for air, shaking with exhaustion and adrenaline.

"Is he—" I couldn't finish the question.

"He's breathing. He's going to be okay." Matt turned to look at me, his expression intense. "You were incredible out there."

"We both were."

"No, I mean it. The way you got him breathing while still in the water—I've never seen anyone do that in those conditions. That kid is alive because of you."

"Because of us," I corrected. "I couldn't have brought him in alone. The current was too strong."

"And I couldn't have gotten him breathing. We needed each other." Matt held my gaze, and something passed between us that had nothing to do with competition or rivalry. Recognition. Understanding. Partnership.

"Carter! Logan!" Captain Ed approached, expression grim but relieved. "That was some of the finest lifeguarding I've ever seen. Textbook rescue technique in extremely dangerous conditions. You saved that boy's life."

"Is he going to be okay, sir?" I asked.

"Ambulance is on the way as precaution, but yes, he's going to be fine. Thanks to you two." Captain Ed's voice was gruff with emotion. "You worked together perfectly out there. Couldn't have done better myself."

The mother appeared, tears streaming down her face, the child wrapped in a towel and clinging to her. "Thank you," she sobbed. "Thank you so much. I just turned away for a second—I didn't see—if you hadn't—"

"He's safe now," Matt said gently. "That's what matters."

The woman reached out and grabbed both our hands, squeezing hard. "Thank you. Thank you."

After she left with Captain Ed to wait for the ambulance, Matt and I sat in silence for a moment. The rest of the crew was handling the crowd, restoring order, posting new guards on our stands. We'd been given a brief moment to recover before we'd need to get back to work.

"That was close," I said finally, my voice still shaky.

"Too close." Matt was staring at his hands. They were trembling slightly. Mine were too.

"I thought we lost him when he went under the second time. I couldn't see him—the water was so murky—"

"But you found him." Matt looked at me, and there was something raw in his expression. Vulnerability I'd never seen before. "You dove down without hesitation. Didn't think about the danger or the current or anything except finding him."

"That's the job."

"That's more than the job, Josie. That's courage."

He'd called me Josie. Not Carter. And somehow that felt more intimate than anything we'd shared in three years.

"You stayed with me the whole time," I said quietly. "Even when the current was pulling us out farther. You could have gone for help, but you stayed."

"I wasn't leaving you out there alone. Not a chance."

We sat there on the sand, shoulder to shoulder, watching the ocean that had nearly taken a child's life and that we'd conquered together. The adrenaline was fading now, leaving behind exhaustion and something else—something warm and unexpected that had nothing to do with competition.

For once, there was no rivalry between us. No defensive posturing. No need to prove anything. Just two lifeguards who'd worked in perfect synchronization to save a life, sitting together in the aftermath and understanding exactly what the other had experienced.

The moment felt significant in a way I couldn't quite articulate. Like something between us had fundamentally changed out there in the water, and we were both feeling the shift without knowing what to call it.

"Logan," I said.

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for having my back out there."

He smiled—not the competitive smirk, but that rare genuine smile that transformed his face. "Always, Carter. Always."

And somehow, I believed him.
