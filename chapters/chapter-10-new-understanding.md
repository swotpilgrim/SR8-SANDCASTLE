# Chapter 10: New Understanding

Sunday morning felt different.

I walked to the beach at my usual time, canvas bag over my shoulder, the early sun warm on my skin. But instead of the familiar knot of competitive tension in my stomach that I'd carried every morning for three years, I felt something else. Anticipation, maybe. Curiosity about how things would be different now that Matt and I were—what? Friends? Partners? Something undefined but definitely changed.

He was already at the lifeguard station when I arrived, checking equipment like always. But when he saw me, his face broke into a genuine smile that made my stomach do an unexpected flip.

"Morning, Carter." Then he paused, reconsidered. "Morning, Josie."

The sound of my first name in his voice still felt new and slightly dangerous. But in a good way.

"Morning, Matt."

His smile widened. "That didn't sound too painful."

"Don't push your luck."

But I was smiling too, and he knew it.

Captain Ed assigned us to stands three and four again—apparently satisfied with how we'd handled yesterday's crisis together. "You two make a good team," he said simply. "Keep it up."

As we walked to our stands, Danny fell into step beside us, grinning like he knew a secret.

"So," he said casually, "you two seem different today."

"Different how?" Matt asked innocently.

"You're walking together instead of maintaining a hostile five-foot buffer. You're smiling. Josie called him Matt instead of Logan." Danny's grin widened. "It's almost like yesterday's rescue knocked some sense into both of you."

"We decided to try being friends," I said. "Is that going to be a problem?"

"Are you kidding? The entire crew has been waiting for this for three years. Linda owes me five dollars."

"You bet on us?" I asked, torn between irritation and amusement.

"Everyone bet on you two. The only question was when you'd finally figure it out." Danny clapped Matt on the shoulder. "About time, man. About time."

He jogged off to his own stand, leaving Matt and me looking at each other.

"Everyone bet on us?" I repeated.

Matt shrugged, looking sheepish. "Apparently we weren't as subtle as we thought about the whole rivalry thing."

"I wasn't trying to be subtle. I was trying to beat you."

"I know. That's what made it interesting." He climbed the ladder to stand four, looking back down at me. "But I think this—" he gestured between us "—is going to be even more interesting."

I climbed to stand three, settling into position, and found myself agreeing.

The morning was busy but not dangerous—calm surf, good weather, families enjoying a Sunday at the beach. The work was routine: scanning the water, signaling swimmers back within boundaries, logging conditions. But the atmosphere felt different.

Every so often, Matt would call over a comment—"Three kids building a sandcastle on the southern boundary," or "Couple with the yellow umbrella are watching their kids, we're good"—and I'd respond with my observations. We were coordinating like we had during yesterday's crisis, maintaining awareness of both zones, working as a team instead of treating our adjacent stands like rival territories.

It felt natural. Easy. Like we'd always been meant to work this way and just hadn't realized it.

During a quiet stretch mid-morning, Matt called over, "Hey, Josie?"

"Yeah?"

"Yesterday, when you told me about your father—" He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Thank you for trusting me with that. I know it wasn't easy to talk about."

My throat tightened. "You were there in the water with me. You understood what that rescue meant in a way most people wouldn't."

"Still. I appreciate you sharing it."

I glanced over at him, saw the sincerity in his expression, and felt something warm settle in my chest. "You're welcome."

A moment of comfortable silence, then Matt added, "My dad's a cop. He's been in situations where he thought someone might die, where he had to make split-second decisions that could mean the difference between life and death. Yesterday reminded me why he loves what he does—that moment when you know you made a difference, that you were there when someone needed you most."

"Does he know you're a lifeguard?"

"Yeah. He's proud of it. Says it's good training—responsibility, quick thinking, staying calm under pressure." Matt's expression softened. "He was the one who suggested I apply three years ago. Thought it would be good for me."

"Was he right?"

"Yeah. Though probably not in the ways he expected." Matt looked at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. "I learned a lot about myself these past three summers. About competition and partnership and—other things."

Before I could ask what "other things" meant, a little girl appeared at the base of my stand, clutching something in her hand.

"'Scuse me," she called up shyly. "Are you the pretty lifeguard who saved the boy yesterday?"

I climbed down, crouching to her level. She couldn't have been more than five or six, with pigtails and a serious expression.

"I was one of the lifeguards who helped him," I said gently. "Why?"

"My mama said I should thank you. She said that could've been me or my brother, and you were very brave." The girl held out her hand, revealing a perfect conch shell, pink and white and beautiful. "This is for you. I found it this morning."

My eyes stung unexpectedly. "That's very sweet, but you should keep it—"

"Mama said to give it to both the lifeguards." The girl pointed at Matt, who'd climbed down from his stand and was watching with a soft expression. "To both of you. She said you work together good."

Matt knelt beside me. "That's very thoughtful. What's your name?"

"Emma."

"Well, Emma, this is a beautiful shell. We'll treasure it. Thank you." Matt took the shell carefully, and Emma beamed at him.

"You're welcome! Mama says I have to stay in the shallow water today and watch for flags."

"That's very smart of you," I said. "You listen to your mama."

"Okay!" Emma skipped off back to her family, and Matt and I stood, looking at the shell in his palm.

"She thinks we work together good," Matt said, a smile tugging at his mouth.

"We do work together good," I corrected with mock seriousness. "Yesterday proved that."

"Should we keep it? Share custody of a shell?"

"That's ridiculous."

"Then you keep it."

"No, you keep it."

We looked at each other and started laughing at the absurdity of arguing over a seashell when we'd spent three years arguing over everything else.

"How about," Matt said, "we put it in the equipment locker as a reminder?"

"A reminder of what?"

"That we make a good team. That we saved a kid's life together. That sometimes the best thing you can do is trust your partner instead of trying to do everything alone."

The words hit deeper than I expected. "Okay. We'll keep it in the locker."

Around noon, Betty showed up with ice cream cones—her lunch break offering of friendship and not-so-subtle encouragement of whatever was developing between Matt and me.

"Strawberry for Josie, chocolate for Matt," she said, handing them over. "And before you ask how I knew Matt's favorite flavor, Danny told me months ago. We've all been preparing for this day."

"You're all ridiculous," I said, but I took the ice cream.

"We're all invested in your happiness," Betty corrected. She looked between us, her expression turning serious. "But really, I'm glad you two finally figured it out. You're good together. Better than you were apart."

After she left, Matt and I ate our ice cream in companionable silence, watching the beach from our respective stands. The sun was high and hot, the water full of swimmers, children building sandcastles and couples walking the shore. A perfect summer day.

"Do you think she's right?" Matt asked. "That we're better together?"

I thought about three years of rivalry, of pushing each other to improve, of the obsessive competition that had driven us both to excel. Then I thought about yesterday—about how perfectly we'd coordinated in the water, how neither of us had to question what the other would do, how naturally we'd worked as a unit.

"Yeah," I said. "I think she might be right."

"Even if it means less competition?"

"Who says it means less competition?" I raised an eyebrow. "We can still compete. We can still push each other to be better. We just don't have to be enemies while we do it."

Matt laughed. "So we're competitive friends?"

"Something like that."

"I can work with that."

The afternoon stretched on, easy and warm. We fell into a rhythm of work and conversation, calling observations across the space between our stands, coordinating our coverage, occasionally just talking about nothing important—his brothers in Philadelphia, my mother's boarding house, the upcoming competition that still loomed six weeks away.

The competition. I'd been so focused on yesterday's rescue and the shift in dynamics that I'd almost forgotten we were still technically rivals for the trophy.

"What happens with the competition?" I asked as the shift drew to a close. "Now that we're friends?"

Matt considered the question seriously. "We still compete. We still train hard and do our best to win. But maybe we don't make each other miserable in the process. Maybe we compete because it makes us both better, not because we're trying to prove something."

"I still want to win."

"Good. So do I." His smile was competitive but no longer hostile. "But if you win, I'll be happy for you. And if I win—"

"I'll try not to throw my trophy in the ocean."

He laughed. "That's all I ask."

As I walked home that evening, I realized that for the first time in three years, I wasn't spending every moment thinking about beating Matt Logan. I was thinking about working with him. Training with him. Being his friend.

And somehow, that felt like a bigger victory than any trophy could be.

My mother noticed the change immediately.

"You look happy," she observed over dinner.

"I had a good day."

"Does this have anything to do with Matt Logan?"

I should have known she'd guess. "We're friends now. After yesterday's rescue, we talked and decided to stop being rivals."

"Just friends?" Her tone was carefully neutral, but her eyes were knowing.

"Yes, just friends." The words felt true but incomplete, like I was leaving something important unsaid. "For now."

My mother smiled. "That's a good start, sweetheart. I'm proud of you for letting him in."

That night, lying in bed, I thought about what she'd said. Letting him in. That's exactly what I'd done yesterday on the beach when I told him about my father, when I took his hand, when I agreed to start over.

I'd spent three years keeping Matt at a distance, using rivalry as a shield against whatever else he might become to me. But yesterday, in the water, when our lives and that child's life depended on perfect partnership, all those walls had crumbled.

And standing in the ruins of my carefully constructed defenses, I'd found something unexpected: the possibility that Matt Logan might become something much more important than either an enemy or a competitor.

He might become someone who mattered.

The thought was terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure.

But I was ready to find out.
