# Chapter 20: Professional Excellence, Personal Misery

Sunday morning arrived with perfect weather—blue skies, gentle breeze, surf that looked postcard-perfect but had enough challenge to test skilled lifeguards.

I should have been excited. Day Two of competition. Still tied with Matt after yesterday's events. Everything I'd trained for all summer coming down to today's final challenges.

Instead, I felt numb.

The beach filled with spectators again—families who'd returned for the conclusion, crew members from competing stations, locals invested in Marina Bay's reputation. The scoreboard from yesterday still showed our tied positions prominently.

Captain Ed gathered all competitors for the Day Two briefing. "Today's events focus on endurance, complex rescues, and teamwork. First up is the mile swim—twice around the full competition course. Then rescue scenarios in simulated rough conditions. Finally, the team event requiring coordinated response."

I caught Matt's eye across the group of competitors. He looked away immediately.

Right. This was how it was going to be.

The mile swim began with three heats of competitors. Matt went in the second heat. I watched him cut through the water with that powerful, efficient stroke—the same stroke I'd been watching all summer, the same strength I'd felt beside me during our real rescue.

He won his heat by a full thirty seconds.

My heat was last. I stood at the water's edge, trying to find motivation beyond just winning. Trying to remember why this had mattered so much in June.

Captain Ed's whistle blew.

I dove and let muscle memory take over. Stroke, stroke, breathe. Around the first buoy, down the beach, around the far marker, back toward start. My arms burned. My lungs screamed. The distance felt endless.

When I finished and checked the board, I'd won my heat. Second fastest overall time—Matt beat me by eighteen seconds.

The crowd applauded. I climbed out of the water feeling nothing but exhaustion.

Betty appeared with a towel. "You were amazing out there."

"Not amazing enough."

"Josie—"

"I need to prep for the next event." I wrapped the towel around myself and walked away before she could say whatever sympathetic thing she was planning.

The rescue simulation came next. Captain Ed had created complex scenarios—multiple victims, simulated rough surf using wave machines, time pressure, safety protocols under stress. Each competitor drew a scenario at random.

Matt drew the worst one—three victims at different distances, all in "distress," with simulated riptide conditions. He'd have to prioritize, execute multiple rescues in sequence, and demonstrate judgment under impossible circumstances.

He was flawless.

I watched him assess the situation in seconds, blow his whistle for backup, go for the furthest victim first—the one who'd be hardest to reach if he tired. He brought the first "victim" back efficiently, handed off to Linda who was playing backup, immediately went for the second, then the third. His form never faltered. His decisions were textbook perfect.

The crowd roared approval when he finished. Even the competing crews from other beaches applauded—professional respect for excellent work.

My scenario wasn't as complex—two victims, one unconscious underwater, one panicking swimmer. But the timing was tight and the expectations were high after Matt's performance.

I dove for the unconscious victim first, pulled them up from eight feet down, started rescue breathing while supporting them in the water. Flagged backup—Danny this time—who took the victim while I went for the panicking swimmer. Approach carefully, talk them down, secure them, bring them back.

When I finished, my time was faster than Matt's. But his scenario had been harder.

Captain Ed announced scores after the rescue simulations. Still essentially tied—Matt ahead by two points. So close that the final event would determine everything.

"Lunch break, then team event at two o'clock," Captain Ed called. "Randomly assigned pairs for coordinated rescue of multiple victims in rough surf. This tests communication, trust, and partnership—qualities essential for professional lifeguards."

Randomly assigned pairs.

I ate lunch alone, sitting on my towel watching families enjoy the beach. Children built sandcastles. Couples walked hand in hand. Normal summer joy that felt impossibly distant from my hollow victory-chasing.

Matt sat with his family—his mother talking animatedly, his brothers roughhousing, Tommy building some elaborate sand fort. Matt laughed at something Kevin said, and I felt the loss like a physical ache.

Two weeks ago, he might have invited me to join them.

Now I was alone with my trophy chase and my carefully rebuilt walls.

Betty sat down beside me without asking permission. "You know you're miserable, right?"

"I'm competing. I'm doing fine."

"You're performing excellently and feeling terrible. Those aren't mutually exclusive." She paused. "Danny told me Matt's leaving tomorrow morning."

"I know."

"So what are you going to do about it?"

"Nothing. I made my choice. He made his. We're both moving on."

"You're both miserable. That's not moving on. That's just suffering separately instead of being happy together."

"Betty—"

"I'm not done. I've watched you all summer, Josie. Watched you train obsessively for this competition. Watched you finally open up to Matt and be genuinely happy for a few weeks. Watched you panic and sabotage it. And now you're about to win this competition—or tie for first, anyway—and you look like you've lost everything that matters. Because you have."

Her words hurt because they were true. But I didn't know how to fix it. Didn't know if Matt would even want me to try after I'd pushed him away so completely.

"After the competition," I said quietly. "If he'll talk to me. After the competition, I'll try."

"Don't wait too long." Betty squeezed my hand. "He's leaving tomorrow morning, Josie. Tomorrow."

At two o'clock, Captain Ed drew random pairings from a hat. Linda got matched with a Surf City guard. Danny drew someone from Long Branch.

Then Captain Ed drew the next two names. "Carter and Logan."

Of course.

Matt's jaw tightened. My stomach dropped. We approached the starting position without speaking. Four "victims" were positioned at varying distances—two in moderate surf, one near the riptide zone, one in the rocky shallows.

This would require strategy, coordination, and perfect trust. The things we'd had during our real rescue. The things we'd lost when I panicked.

Captain Ed explained the rules briefly. "Any questions?"

We both shook our heads.

The whistle blew.

Training took over. "You take the riptide and right side, I'll take the rocks and left side," Matt said, clipped and professional.

We dove simultaneously.

Everything else fell away. In the water, we were lifeguards. In the water, we were partners.

I reached my rocky victim first—secured her, navigated the treacherous footing, signaled Matt. He was already at the riptide victim, executing perfect form. I focused on my second victim—panicking swimmer. Approached from behind, talked them calm, brought them back while Matt delivered the riptide rescue.

Our fourth victim required rescue breathing. Without discussion, we went together. Matt started breathing, I supported, we transported while maintaining airway.

Eight minutes total.

When we reached shore, the beach erupted in applause. "Fastest time of the day," Captain Ed announced. "Outstanding work, Carter and Logan."

Matt and I stood dripping and breathing hard, not looking at each other. We'd just executed a perfect rescue—moved like one person, trusted completely. And the moment we reached shore, the walls went back up.

"Good work," Matt said formally.

"You too."

He walked toward his family. I walked toward my towel. The partnership dissolved.

Betty watched with a sad expression. "You two are idiots."

"I know."

The remaining pairs finished. None were as fast as us.

Captain Ed gathered everyone for final scoring. The crowd pressed close.

"Third place: Linda Hayes."

Applause. Linda accepted her trophy.

"For the first time in eight years, we have an exact tie for first place. Co-winners, with one hundred ninety-six points each: Josie Carter and Matt Logan."

The crowd erupted. Captain Ed held up two identical trophies.

Matt stepped forward first, accepting his trophy with a polite smile. His family mobbed him.

Then my turn. I accepted the trophy, shook Captain Ed's hand. The metal was cool and heavy. My name was engraved next to Matt's.

*Marina Bay Beach Lifeguard Competition*
*Co-Winners*
*Matt Logan & Josie Carter*
*August 1957*

The trophy I'd wanted desperately all summer. I held it and felt absolutely nothing.

I'd won the trophy. And I'd lost Matt.

The crowd celebrated around me—congratulations, photos, applause. Matt was surrounded by his family. I stood alone holding my trophy, watching him through the crowd.

Victory meant nothing without someone to share it with. Being the best lifeguard meant nothing if I was too broken to let myself be loved.

All my training, all my determination, all my fierce independence—it had gotten me a trophy and an empty heart.

I'd spent three years competing with Matt, then weeks falling for him, then one terrible night pushing him away because vulnerability terrified me more than drowning.

Now he was leaving tomorrow. I was holding the prize that was supposed to make me feel complete, and all I felt was hollow.

The celebration continued as the sun set over Marina Bay, painting the sky in oranges and pinks. Beautiful ending to the competition.

But I couldn't feel any of it.

I'd finally learned what I should have understood weeks ago: partnership wasn't weakness. Love wasn't loss of self. Vulnerability wasn't the same as helplessness.

But I'd learned it too late.

Matt was leaving tomorrow. And I was staying here alone with my trophy and my walls and my carefully protected heart that hurt more now than it ever would have if I'd just been brave enough to risk it.
