# Chapter 15: Growing Attraction

The following week passed in a blur of happiness I'd never experienced before.

Matt and I spent every possible moment together—arriving early for our shifts to share coffee, eating lunch with our lifeguard stands pulled close enough to talk, walking the beach together after work. We held hands constantly, as if afraid that letting go meant losing this fragile new thing we'd built.

The crew teased us mercilessly, but it was good-natured. Danny had indeed won his bet and bought everyone ice cream to celebrate. Captain Ed watched us with something like satisfaction, as if he'd known all along how this would end. Even the new guards, who hadn't witnessed our three-year rivalry, noticed the easy partnership between us.

"You two are like one person split into two bodies," one of them said during a training session. "You coordinate perfectly without even talking."

He was right. On the lifeguard stands, Matt and I moved in synchronization—spotting dangers simultaneously, coordinating responses without discussion, covering each other's zones instinctively. Off the stands, we were equally in sync. I'd reach for my water bottle and find Matt already handing it to me. He'd start a sentence and I'd finish it. We fell into rhythm as naturally as breathing.

It should have felt comfortable. Safe. Easy.

Instead, as the days passed, I felt a growing knot of anxiety in my chest.

Tuesday afternoon, Betty found me restocking my first aid kit during a quiet stretch, my hands moving mechanically while my mind churned.

"You look worried," she observed, settling in the sand beside my stand.

"I'm fine."

"Josie. I know you. What's wrong?"

I set down the bandages, trying to organize my thoughts. "Everything's perfect. Matt's perfect. We're perfect together. Everyone says so."

"But?"

"But what if it's too perfect? What if I'm depending on him too much, needing him too much?" The words tumbled out faster now, fear I'd been suppressing for days finally breaking free. "Betty, I think about him constantly. I look forward to seeing him so much it actually hurts when we're apart. I changed my whole morning routine to match his. I'm planning my future around his schedule. This is exactly what I was afraid of—losing myself in someone else."

Betty was quiet for a moment, then asked gently, "Are you losing yourself? Or are you just letting someone in?"

"What's the difference?"

"Losing yourself means giving up things that matter to you, compromising your values, becoming less than you were. Letting someone in means sharing your life, being vulnerable, allowing yourself to need someone." Betty squeezed my hand. "Which one is actually happening?"

I thought about it honestly. "I'm still me. I'm still training hard, still focused on the competition, still the same lifeguard I've always been. I haven't given up anything important."

"Then what are you really afraid of?"

"That I love him so much it will destroy me if I lose him." The admission came out as a whisper. "Like it almost destroyed me when I lost Dad."

"Oh, Josie." Betty pulled me into a hug. "Love is always a risk. There are no guarantees. But you can't protect yourself from loss by refusing to love. You just end up lonely and safe instead of happy and vulnerable."

"Safe feels better than hurt."

"Does it? Because you've been safe for five years, and you've been miserable. Now you're vulnerable and you're happy. Scared, yes, but happy. Isn't that better?"

I pulled back, wiping my eyes. "When did you get so wise?"

"I've always been wise. You just finally started listening."

That evening, Matt noticed my distraction immediately. We were walking the beach after our shift, and I'd been quiet for several minutes, lost in my anxious thoughts.

"Hey," he said softly, stopping and turning to face me. "Where'd you go just now?"

"What do you mean?"

"You're physically here, but mentally you're somewhere else. Somewhere that looks worrying." Matt tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. "Talk to me, Josie. What's going on in that head of yours?"

I wanted to deflect, to say I was fine, to keep the fear locked safely inside where it couldn't touch what we'd built. But we'd promised honesty. No more walls.

"I'm scared," I admitted. "Of how much I need you already. How much you've become a part of my daily life. How much it would hurt if—" I couldn't finish the sentence.

"If you lost me," Matt finished gently. "Like you lost your dad."

"Yeah."

He was quiet for a moment, then said, "Come with me. I want to show you something."

He led me to the marina where his aunt and uncle's business was. The sun was setting, casting golden light across the water, boats bobbing gently in their slips. Matt guided me to the end of the longest dock, where we sat with our legs dangling over the water.

"See these boats?" Matt gestured at the marina full of vessels. "Some of them never leave the dock. Owners keep them tied up tight because they're afraid of storms, afraid of damage, afraid of losing their investment. Those boats are perfectly safe. They'll never sink in a storm."

"Okay?"

"But they'll also never go anywhere. They'll just sit here, safe and useless, never fulfilling their purpose." Matt looked at me. "And then there are boats like that one—" he pointed to a weathered fishing boat, clearly well-used, showing signs of many trips and minor repairs. "That boat's been in storms. It's been battered and fixed and battered again. It's not perfect or pristine. But it's lived. It's done what boats are supposed to do—gone places, carried people, experienced the ocean."

I understood what he was saying. "You think I'm trying to be the boat that never leaves the dock."

"I think you're trying to protect yourself from storms by refusing to sail. And I understand why—you've been through a terrible storm already." Matt took my hand. "But Josie, you're not meant to sit in the marina. You're meant to sail. You're brave and strong and capable of weathering any storm that comes."

"What if the storm sinks me?"

"Then I'll be right beside you with a life vest and a rescue plan. Because that's what we do—we're lifeguards. We save people. We save each other."

Tears spilled over despite my best efforts to hold them back. "I'm so afraid of losing you."

"I know. And I can't promise you won't lose me someday. None of us get guarantees." Matt wiped my tears with his thumb. "But I can promise that every day we have together is worth the risk. That loving you is worth whatever pain might come later. And that I'm not going anywhere if I have any say in it."

"How are you so sure?"

"Because I've spent three years watching you from a distance, competing with you, wanting to know you. And now that I finally do know you, now that I get to love you? There's nowhere else I'd rather be. Nothing else I'd rather risk."

I leaned against him, letting him wrap his arms around me, letting myself be held and comforted and loved. The fear was still there—it might always be there. But Matt was right. The alternative was staying safe in the marina, never sailing, never truly living.

And I'd spent five years in that marina. I was done with safe.

"Okay," I said finally.

"Okay what?"

"Okay, I'll stop trying to protect myself from happiness. I'll sail instead of staying docked. I'll risk the storms because you're worth it."

Matt kissed the top of my head. "We're worth it. Together."

Wednesday brought Matt's family to Marina Bay for their promised visit. His mother Helen was warm and kind, immediately hugging me like I was already part of the family. His father Robert had Matt's build and steady demeanor, shaking my hand firmly while studying me with cop's eyes that seemed to approve of what they saw.

And his brothers were exactly as advertised—Tommy showing off by doing flips on the beach, Kevin asking me detailed questions about lifeguard training and rescue techniques, Jamie immediately latching onto Matt and demanding piggyback rides and attention.

"Sorry," Matt said as Jamie climbed on his back for the third time. "He's clingy when he hasn't seen me in a while."

"It's sweet," I said honestly. Watching Matt with his brothers showed a different side of him—patient, playful, protective. The oldest brother taking care of his family. It made me love him even more.

Helen pulled me aside while the boys were swimming. "Matt talks about you constantly," she said. "In his letters, on the phone. You've made quite an impression."

"He talks about you too," I said. "He admires you so much—how you balance work and family."

"It's not always easy. But it's worth it." She smiled, watching her sons play in the water. "Matt told me about losing your father. I'm so sorry, Josie. That must have been incredibly hard."

"It was. Still is, sometimes."

"Robert and I worry about Matt being so far from home during summers. But knowing he has you here—someone he cares about, someone who understands the responsibility of lifeguarding—it gives us peace of mind." Helen squeezed my hand. "You're good for him. And from what I can see, he's good for you too."

"He is," I agreed, watching Matt swing Jamie around in the shallow water while Tommy and Kevin splashed them. "He's very good for me."

That evening, after Matt's family left to drive back to Philadelphia, we sat on my lifeguard stand watching the sunset. The beach was nearly empty, just a few evening walkers and one couple playing in the waves.

"Your family is wonderful," I said.

"They really liked you. Mom pulled me aside and told me not to mess this up."

"Smart woman."

Matt laughed, then grew serious. "Josie, I need to tell you something."

My stomach tightened. "Okay?"

"I got a letter yesterday. From Rutgers. They want me to come back a week early for football training camp. I'd have to leave Marina Bay on August twentieth instead of the twenty-seventh."

August twentieth. That was three days after the competition. Just three days.

"Oh," I managed.

"I know we said we'd have the last week of summer together. And I tried to get out of it, but it's mandatory for scholarship athletes." Matt looked miserable. "I'm so sorry."

"No, don't apologize. This is important for your future. You have to go."

"But it means less time with you."

"We'll make the most of the time we have." I forced a smile. "And then we'll figure out the distance thing, just like we planned."

Matt pulled me close. "I hate that I'm leaving sooner."

"Me too. But it's okay. We're okay."

And we were okay. We would be okay.

But lying in bed that night, the anxiety crept back. Summer was already more than half over. Soon Matt would leave, and we'd be navigating long distance, and everything would get harder. The happiness I'd found felt precious and fragile, like it could shatter at any moment.

I loved Matt. Deeply, completely, frighteningly. And that love made me vulnerable in ways I still wasn't sure I could handle.

But I'd made my choice. I was sailing, not staying docked. Whatever storms came, I'd weather them.

Because Matt Logan was worth the risk.

I just hoped I was brave enough to keep believing that when things got hard.
