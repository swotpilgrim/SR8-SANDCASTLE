# Chapter 23: Racing Against Time

I stood on the marina dock facing Matt, early morning sun warming my back, and tried to find the courage to be completely honest for the first time in my life.

He waited, arms crossed, expression guarded. Ready to listen but not willing to be hurt again easily. I'd done that to him—made him defensive where he'd once been open, careful where he'd once been vulnerable.

"I'm sorry," I started. The words felt inadequate. "For running away after you asked to kiss me. For reverting back to treating you like a rival. For pushing you away when you tried to talk to me. For the cold distance these past weeks. For hurting you when all you ever did was try to get past my walls."

Matt's expression didn't soften, but he nodded slightly. Acknowledgment, not forgiveness.

"Why?" he asked simply. "Why did you run? I asked permission, Josie. I didn't push. I gave you time. And you still ran away like I'd done something terrible."

"You didn't do anything terrible. You did everything right." I forced myself to hold his gaze even though vulnerability felt like standing naked on the beach. "That's what scared me. You were perfect. You asked permission. You listened when I talked about my father. You made me feel seen and safe and needed. And needing someone terrifies me more than drowning."

"Why?"

The question was soft but insistent. Matt deserved a real answer, not just surface explanation.

I looked out at the water, gathering courage, then back at him.

"My father drowned when I was twelve. I told you that part. What I didn't tell you was how it broke me. How I watched my mother fall apart with grief. How I tried to be strong enough for both of us. How I swore I'd never let myself need someone that way—so deeply that losing them would destroy me."

Matt's arms uncrossed slightly. Still listening, still guarded, but something in his expression had shifted toward understanding.

"So I became strong," I continued. "Independent. Self-sufficient. The girl who didn't need anyone. The lifeguard who could handle anything alone. And when you came along with that joke three years ago, I turned you into my enemy because that was safer than admitting I was attracted to you. Competition was safer than connection."

"And after the rescue? When we finally started connecting?"

"I was terrified every single day," I admitted. "Every conversation we had, every moment we spent together, every time you smiled at me—I felt myself wanting you more. Needing you more. And the more I needed you, the more scared I became of losing you."

"So you pushed me away first," Matt said quietly. "Before I could leave or die or disappear like your father."

"Yes." The word came out barely above a whisper.

We stood in silence for a moment, the marina waking up around us. A fishing boat motored past. Seagulls called overhead.

"That's a terrible way to live," Matt said finally. "Pushing away everything good because you're afraid of losing it. That's not protection, Josie. That's just loneliness."

"I know. I'm finally starting to understand that." I stepped closer, closing some of the physical distance between us even though emotional distance still stretched wide. "The weeks after I pushed you away were the most miserable of my entire summer. Worse than my father's death in some ways, because at least that wasn't my choice. This was. I chose the loneliness. I chose to be scared instead of brave."

"And now? What are you choosing now?"

"I'm choosing to tell you the truth, even though it terrifies me."

"What truth?"

This was it. Risk everything or stay safe.

I took a breath and committed.

"I've been in love with you since that night at the marina. Maybe longer—maybe since the rescue, or even before that. I love you, Matt Logan. I love your patience and your kindness and the way you've waited for me. I love how you talk about your brothers. I love that you ask permission. I love everything about you, and I've been too afraid to admit it because loving you means risking losing you, and I didn't think I could survive that."

Matt's expression went still. Unreadable.

"But these past weeks taught me something. I was so focused on protecting myself from future pain that I created present pain. I hurt you. I hurt myself. I destroyed something beautiful because I was too scared to let it exist." Tears spilled over. "That hurt worse than any loss I was trying to avoid."

I wiped my face with shaking hands.

"So I'm here. I'm telling you I was wrong. Wrong to hold that grudge. Wrong to push you away. Wrong to think being strong meant being alone. I'm sorry, Matt."

The words hung between us. I'd laid it all out. Now it was his turn.

Matt ran a hand through his hair. When he spoke, his voice was quiet and tired.

"These past weeks have been hell. Watching you compete, working that perfect rescue together, then having you treat me like a stranger. Seeing you miserable at the bonfire, wanting to comfort you but knowing you'd pushed me away too many times."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"I've been patient for three years, Josie. Three years of trying to apologize. Three years of competing while half in love with you. When you finally let me in, I thought we had a chance."

"I did feel it. I do."

"Then why does loving me scare you so much?"

"Because when my father died, needing him didn't help. Loving him didn't save him. I was helpless. I swore I'd never be helpless again."

Matt stepped closer.

"Love isn't about control," he said quietly. "It's about choosing to be vulnerable even though you might lose them. It's deciding that having them in your life is worth the risk."

"I know that logically—"

"You dive into dangerous water every day because saving people is worth the danger. Why can't you do that with your heart?"

The question hit hard.

"Maybe because I've never loved anyone the way I love you, and it's bigger and scarier than anything I've ever felt."

Something flickered in Matt's expression. Not forgiveness yet, but understanding.

"I've loved you for three years. Competing while wanting you. Trying to be your friend while being in love with you. I've been vulnerable from the beginning, Josie. Every time I tried to apologize. Every time I hoped you'd finally see me."

Tears ran down my face. "I'm sorry I couldn't see what you were offering."

"Stop apologizing. I need to know if you've actually changed, or if this is just panic because I'm leaving."

The question was fair. Brutally fair.

"I've changed. These past weeks have been empty. Winning that competition meant nothing because you weren't celebrating with me. Being the best lifeguard meant nothing because I'd lost the best partner I'd ever had. I finally understand that being strong means being brave enough to let people in, even though they might hurt you or leave you."

Matt studied my face, weighing my words.

"I want to believe you. I want to believe this is real and you won't panic next time things feel intense."

"I won't run. I promise."

"You promised things before. Then you ran."

The truth hurt, but I couldn't deny it.

"You're right. I can't promise I won't be scared sometimes. But I can promise I'll tell you when I'm scared instead of running. I can promise I'll try to be vulnerable even when it terrifies me. I can promise I'll choose you over my fear, over and over."

Matt's uncle appeared, calling about catching the tide.

Time was running out.

Matt glanced at the boat, then at me, clearly torn.

"I need to go. My uncle needs help with this delivery."

My heart sank. "I understand."

"But Josie?" He touched my face gently, thumb brushing away tears. "I've waited three years for you. I can wait a little longer while you prove you're serious about this."

"How long will you be gone?"

"A week. Boat delivery to Philadelphia, then helping with marina work. I'll be back before Labor Day."

A week. Seven days to prove I meant it.

"I'll be here when you get back. And Matt? I do mean it. I love you."

He studied my face, then leaned down and kissed my forehead—soft, gentle, full of possibility but not quite trust yet.

"We'll see," he said quietly.

Then he turned and walked to the cabin cruiser, jumping aboard with easy grace. The engine started. The boat pulled away slowly, navigating out of the slip.

I stood on the dock watching him leave, morning sun bright on the water, and felt the strangest mix of heartbreak and hope.

I'd been honest. Completely, vulnerably honest.

And Matt hadn't rejected me entirely. He'd just asked me to prove I meant it.

The cabin cruiser motored out of the marina and disappeared around the jetty, taking Matt with it.

Seven days.

Seven days to prove I was brave enough to love him.

Seven days to show that I'd finally learned what mattered most.

I walked back down the dock toward Marina Bay, my heart lighter than it had been in weeks despite the ache of his departure.

Because for the first time in five years, I'd chosen courage over fear.

And that had to count for something.
