# Chapter 27: The Apology and Promise

Tuesday morning, Matt picked me up at my boarding house to drive to the beach together. It was a small thing—sharing a ride—but it felt momentous. Public acknowledgment that we were together now. A couple.

My mother met him at the door, sizing him up with maternal scrutiny.

"Matt Logan," she said. "I've heard a lot about you."

"Ma'am." Matt extended his hand politely. "All good things, I hope."

"Some better than others." But she was smiling. "You're the boy who waited three years for my daughter to stop being stubborn?"

"Mom," I protested, embarrassed.

"Yes, ma'am," Matt said, unbothered. "Though in fairness, she was worth waiting for."

My mother's expression softened completely. "I can see why Josie likes you. You're patient and kind. Those are good qualities in a partner."

"I try."

"Take care of her. And Matt?" She fixed him with a serious look. "She's braver than she thinks she is. When she gets scared—and she will get scared—remind her of that."

"I will. I promise."

In the car, I groaned and covered my face. "I'm so sorry. She's been waiting weeks to interrogate you."

"I like her. She's protective. That's good." Matt reached over and took my hand. "And she's right. You are braver than you think."

We arrived at the beach to find the crew already gathered, and the moment we walked up holding hands, Danny whooped loudly.

"Finally! I told you they'd figure it out!"

Betty ran over from the ice cream shop and hugged me tight. "About damn time."

"Language, Betty," Captain Ed called, but he was smiling.

Linda approached more quietly. "I'm happy for you both. Really. You belong together."

"Thanks, Linda. That means a lot."

The rest of the crew congratulated us with varying degrees of teasing and sincerity. It felt good—being open about our relationship, not hiding or pretending, just being together without walls or fear.

Captain Ed pulled us aside before shift started. "Carter. Logan. I'm glad you two worked things out. But I need to know this won't affect your work. You're both professionals, but relationships can be distracting."

"It won't be a problem, sir," Matt said. "If anything, we work better together."

"That's what I've seen. Just keep it professional during work hours. Save the romance for after shift." He paused, expression softening. "But off the record? I'm happy for you both. You're good for each other."

"Thank you, Captain."

Working side by side with Matt on adjacent stands felt completely different now. Before, I'd been hyperaware of him—competitive, defensive, attracted but unwilling to admit it. Then came the period after the rescue when everything was changing but I was too scared to accept it.

Now? Now it felt easy.

We communicated effortlessly. Coordinated responses without discussion. Checked in with each other during quiet moments. Partnership in its purest form.

"Swimmer drifting near the riptide zone," Matt called mid-morning.

"I see him. Approaching from south."

We both responded, reaching the swimmer simultaneously and guiding him back to safe water. The whole rescue took less than two minutes—textbook coordination.

The swimmer thanked us profusely. "You two work so well together. How long have you been partners?"

"All summer," I said.

"Forever," Matt said at the same time.

We looked at each other and laughed.

During lunch break, we sat together on my towel eating sandwiches. Betty joined us, grinning.

"So. You two are finally together. Does this mean you're going to get married and have a million babies and name your first daughter after me?"

"Betty!" I threw sand at her.

"What? I'm just planning ahead. I'd be an excellent godmother."

Matt laughed. "Let us get through next semester first. Then we'll discuss the million babies."

"I'm holding you to that." Betty squeezed my hand. "Seriously though, Josie. I'm really happy for you. You deserve this. You both do."

After she left, Matt turned to me. "A million babies seems excessive."

"Definitely excessive."

"Maybe just three or four."

I stared at him. He was completely serious.

"You've thought about this," I said slowly.

"Of course I've thought about this. I've been in love with you for three years, Josie. I've thought about everything—dating you, marrying you, building a life with you. All of it." He took my hand. "I know it's too soon to talk about that stuff seriously. We're just starting. But yeah, I think about the future. I think about us having a future."

My heart swelled. "I think about it too. Not the details, not yet. But the idea of a future with you in it. That doesn't scare me anymore. It makes me happy."

"Good. Because I plan to be in your future for a very long time."

That afternoon, a little girl approached my stand—maybe seven years old, holding a bucket and shovel.

"Excuse me," she said shyly. "Can you help me build a sandcastle?"

I glanced at Matt, who nodded. "Go ahead. It's quiet."

I climbed down and followed the little girl to where her family had set up camp. For the next twenty minutes, we built an elaborate sandcastle together—towers and walls, a moat around the perimeter, shells decorating the top.

"My dad died last year," the girl said suddenly, patting sand into a tower. "Mom says coming to the beach makes us feel close to him again because he loved the ocean."

My chest tightened. "I'm sorry. That's really hard."

"Yeah. But it's getting better. Mom says grief gets smaller over time. Not gone, just smaller. Like it makes room for other happy things too."

"Your mom sounds wise."

"She is." The girl stuck a shell on top of the highest tower. "Were you scared? When you became a lifeguard? Because the ocean can be dangerous?"

"I was," I admitted. "I am, sometimes. But I do it anyway because helping people is more important than being afraid."

She considered this seriously. "That's brave."

"So are you. For coming back to the ocean even though it hurts to remember your dad. That takes courage."

The girl smiled—small but genuine. "Thanks for helping with my castle."

"Anytime."

When I climbed back to my stand, Matt was watching me with a soft expression.

"What?" I asked.

"You're really good with kids."

"Don't start with the baby talk again."

"Wouldn't dream of it." But he was smiling.

As shift ended, we secured our stands and walked toward the parking area together. The beach was emptying, families heading home after another day of summer vacation. Only a few more days until Labor Day, then the season would officially end.

"I've been thinking," Matt said as we reached his car. "About everything that happened this summer. The competition, the rescue, us. And I realized something."

"What's that?"

"I spent three years competing with you, trying to prove I was good enough. Trying to earn your respect and eventually your affection. But what I should have been doing was showing you we were better as partners than as rivals."

"You did show me. During the rescue. During the team event at competition. Every time we worked together, you showed me what partnership could be."

"But you weren't ready to see it. You were too focused on protecting yourself." He took both my hands. "And I understand that now. I understand why you needed to keep me at a distance. Why letting me in felt so dangerous."

"I'm sorry I wasted so much time being scared."

"Don't be sorry. Be here now. Be brave now." He kissed me gently. "That's all I need. Just you, choosing us, over and over."

"I can do that. I will do that." I squeezed his hands. "Matt, I need you to know something. I'm going to mess up sometimes. I'm going to have moments where the fear comes back, where I panic and want to run. My father's death broke something in me, and I'm still learning how to trust that loving someone won't destroy me."

"I know. And when those moments come, we'll work through them together."

"You're sure? You're really sure you want to deal with all my baggage and fear and stubbornness?"

"Josie." He cupped my face in his hands. "I've wanted to deal with your baggage and fear and stubbornness for three years. I've been waiting for you to let me in. Now that you finally have, I'm not walking away because it's hard sometimes. That's not how love works."

"How does it work?"

"You show up. You're honest. You choose each other even when it's difficult. You forgive mistakes and try again." He smiled. "And you trust that partnership makes both people stronger."

I kissed him, not caring that we were in the parking area where anyone might see. Let them see. I wasn't hiding anymore.

"I love you," I said against his lips. "And I choose you. Today and tomorrow and every day after that."

"I love you too. Have for three years. Will for the rest of my life."

We drove back to my boarding house with the radio playing and our hands linked between the seats. When he walked me to my door, my mother watched from the window with that knowing smile parents get when they see their children happy.

"See you tomorrow?" Matt asked.

"Tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that."

"Sounds perfect."

He kissed me goodnight—sweet and lingering and full of promise—then walked back to his car. I watched him drive away, feeling lighter than I had in five years.

Because I'd finally learned what my mother and Captain Ed and Betty had been trying to tell me all summer: Strength wasn't about being invulnerable. It was about being brave enough to be vulnerable.

Love wasn't about avoiding pain. It was about deciding someone was worth the risk.

And Matt Logan was worth every risk I'd ever have to take.

Now I just had to keep proving that to him—and to myself—one day at a time.

One choice at a time.

One brave moment at a time.
