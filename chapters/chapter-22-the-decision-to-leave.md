# Chapter 22: The Decision to Leave

I didn't sleep.

I lay in bed watching the ceiling fan rotate, listening to distant waves, counting hours until morning. The trophy sat on my dresser catching moonlight—a silent witness to my sleepless regret.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Matt's face. Matt laughing with his brother. Matt executing that perfect rescue. Matt asking if he could kiss me, expression hopeful and vulnerable. Matt's hurt when I ran away.

I'd spent three years competing with him, weeks falling for him, and one terrible night pushing him away.

Tomorrow—today, now, since dawn was breaking—I had one last chance to fix it.

If I could find the courage.

Around five-thirty, I gave up pretending I might sleep. I dressed quickly in capri pants and a blouse, nothing fancy, just myself. If I was going to be vulnerable and honest, I should at least look like the real me—not some polished version trying to impress.

My mother was awake when I came downstairs, sitting at the kitchen table with her morning coffee.

"You're up early," she said, studying my face. "Couldn't sleep?"

"Not really."

"Big day today?"

I nodded, suddenly close to tears. "Matt's leaving this morning. Boat delivery to Philadelphia. And I—" My voice cracked. "I need to tell him. Before he goes. I need to tell him I was wrong."

My mother set down her coffee cup and pulled me into a hug. "I'm proud of you."

"I haven't done anything yet. I might lose my nerve."

"You won't. You're one of the bravest people I know, Josie. You dive into dangerous water to save people without hesitation. You can do this."

"Saving people from drowning is easier than risking my own heart."

"I know." She pulled back, looking at me seriously. "But being brave isn't the absence of fear. It's feeling the fear and doing the thing anyway. You feel terrified right now?"

"Absolutely."

"Good. That means it matters. That means it's real." She squeezed my hands. "Go tell that boy you love him. Even if he doesn't want to hear it. Even if it's too late. At least you'll know you tried."

I hugged her tight, grateful beyond words for her understanding, then headed for the door.

"Josie?" my mother called. "Your father would be so proud of you. Not because you won that competition, but because you're finally learning that needing people doesn't make you weak. It makes you human."

The words followed me out the door and down the quiet morning streets of Marina Bay.

The town was just waking up—a few early risers walking dogs, a delivery truck rumbling past, seagulls calling overhead. The boardwalk was empty. The beach stretched peaceful and perfect in the early light.

I went to the beach first, hoping maybe Matt had gone for one last early morning run before leaving. But the sand was empty except for sandpipers chasing waves and the remnants of last night's bonfire—cold ashes and scattered logs marking where the celebration had been.

No Matt.

I walked to the lifeguard station. Empty. The stands stood silent, waiting for the day's guards. Everything looked the same as always, but felt different knowing Matt would be gone soon. Knowing our partnership at adjacent stands had ended.

Where was he?

Captain Ed emerged from his office as I approached the station, carrying his morning thermos and newspaper.

"Josie," he said in surprise. "You're up early."

"I'm looking for Matt. Is he here?"

Captain Ed's expression softened with understanding. "Ah. No, he left about an hour ago. Said goodbye to me last night after the bonfire."

My heart sank. "He already left? But I thought—I heard he was helping his uncle with a boat delivery this morning—"

"He is. They're leaving at seven from the marina." Captain Ed checked his watch. "Which gives you about forty minutes if you hurry."

Forty minutes. Not much time.

"Captain—" I hesitated, not sure what I wanted to ask. "Do you think I'm too late?"

"Too late for what?"

"To apologize. To tell him I was wrong. To—" I couldn't quite say it. "To fix what I broke."

Captain Ed studied me with those perceptive eyes that had been evaluating lifeguards for fifteen years. "You know what I told you when you first joined the crew? I said being a good lifeguard means making split-second decisions and living with the consequences. You assess the situation, make your choice, and commit."

"I remember."

"Well, relationships are the same. You made a choice when you pushed Matt away—that was your assessment of the risk. And you've lived with the consequences for the past weeks. Now you're making a different choice. And you'll live with those consequences too, whatever they are."

"What if he won't forgive me?"

"Then you'll know you tried. You'll know you were brave enough to be vulnerable even though it scared you. That's better than spending your life wondering what might have happened if you'd just had the courage to be honest." He gestured toward the street. "But standing here asking me questions won't help. The marina is fifteen minutes away if you walk. Ten if you run."

"Thank you, Captain."

"Josie?" He called as I started to leave. "Matt's a good man. The kind who doesn't give his heart easily, but when he does, he means it. Don't waste what he's been trying to give you."

"I won't. Not anymore."

I started walking quickly down the street, then broke into a jog. The morning air was cool and fresh, carrying the smell of salt water and possibility. My feet pounded against the sidewalk—past the boarding houses, past Betty's ice cream shop with its closed shutters, past the stores and restaurants still quiet before the day's business.

Ten minutes, Captain Ed had said. I could make it in ten minutes.

I had to.

Marina Bay's streets were familiar territory after a summer of walking them, but this morning they felt different. Each corner, each block, reminded me of moments with Matt. The ice cream parlor where we'd shared a sundae. The street where we'd first walked together after the rescue. The spot where I'd seen him helping his little brothers.

Memories of a summer that had been perfect for a few brief weeks before I destroyed it with fear.

I ran faster.

The marina came into view—boats bobbing in their slips, morning sun glinting off water, the smell of diesel fuel and fish and salt air. A few early fishermen were preparing their boats for a day's work. At the end of the farthest dock, I could see movement around a cabin cruiser.

Matt's uncle's boat. The one they were taking to Philadelphia.

I slowed to a fast walk, trying to catch my breath, suddenly terrified. What was I going to say? How could I possibly explain weeks of fear and stupidity and push-pull behavior that must have left Matt completely confused?

And more importantly—what if he didn't want to hear it?

What if I'd hurt him too many times, pushed him away too often, and he was simply done waiting for me to figure out what I wanted?

I could turn around. Go home. Let him leave. Save myself the pain and humiliation of rejection.

But my mother's words echoed in my head: *Being brave isn't the absence of fear. It's feeling the fear and doing the thing anyway.*

And Captain Ed's advice: *You assess the situation, make your choice, and commit.*

I'd made my choice.

Now I had to commit.

I walked down the dock toward the cabin cruiser, my heart hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears. The wooden planks creaked under my feet. Water lapped against boat hulls. Seagulls called overhead.

As I got closer, I could see Matt on the deck of the cabin cruiser, coiling rope with practiced efficiency. He was wearing dungarees and a work shirt, his hair already wind-blown, looking capable and handsome and like he was about to walk out of my life forever.

An older man—Matt's uncle, I assumed—was in the cabin checking gauges and switches. He was saying something about fuel levels and weather forecasts.

I stopped at the edge of the dock, ten feet from the boat, and opened my mouth to call Matt's name.

Nothing came out.

All my carefully rehearsed words evaporated. All my planned explanations disappeared. I stood there frozen, terrified, desperately wanting to speak but unable to make my voice work.

Matt looked up.

Our eyes met across the space between dock and boat.

His expression shifted—surprise, then something guarded and careful. Hurt wrapped in protective distance.

"Josie," he said, his voice neutral. "What are you doing here?"

His uncle looked up at the sound of my name, glanced between us, and made some excuse about checking the engine below deck. He disappeared, leaving us alone on opposite sides of the gap.

Matt stood on the boat. I stood on the dock. Ten feet of space and weeks of hurt and fear between us.

"I—" My voice came out strangled. "I heard you were leaving this morning. I needed to—I wanted to—"

I stopped, took a breath, tried again.

"I came to apologize."

Matt's expression didn't change. "You didn't need to do that."

"Yes, I did. I needed to—" The words stuck in my throat. "Can we talk? Please? Before you leave?"

For a long moment, Matt didn't respond. He just looked at me with those eyes that had watched me all summer—competitive and admiring and frustrated and hurt. Weighing whether to let me speak or protect himself by refusing.

Finally, he sighed. "Okay. Let me tell my uncle."

He disappeared into the cabin, emerged a moment later, and jumped from the boat to the dock with easy grace. We walked in silence to the end of the dock where we could have privacy, the morning sun warm on our backs, the bay sparkling around us.

When we stopped and turned to face each other, Matt crossed his arms and waited.

"I'm listening," he said quietly. "But Josie, I need you to be honest. Completely honest. No walls, no defenses, no running away. Just the truth. Can you do that?"

Could I?

I looked at him—really looked at him—and saw the hurt I'd caused, the patience he'd shown, the three years he'd waited for me to stop being angry and see what he'd been trying to offer.

And I knew I owed him the truth, even if it terrified me.

Even if he rejected me.

Even if this was my last chance.

"Yes," I said. "I can do that. I will."

"Okay." Matt's voice was still guarded, but he was listening. "Then talk."
