# Chapter 13: Admitting the Truth

Friday afternoon, Betty cornered me at Kowalski's Ice Cream Parlor during my lunch break. One look at her face told me she'd been waiting for this conversation.

"Spill," she said, sliding into the booth across from me and pushing a strawberry milkshake my way. "And don't even think about pretending you don't know what I'm talking about."

I took a sip of the milkshake, buying time. "What do you want to know?"

"Everything. You and Matt have been walking around with these dopey smiles for days. Yesterday I saw you holding hands on the beach. And Danny said you two were the closing guards last night and didn't finish until well after dark."

"We were talking."

"For two hours?"

"We had a lot to talk about."

Betty leaned forward, eyes sparkling with curiosity and affection. "Josie Carter, you are finally letting that boy into your heart, and I want to hear every single detail."

I couldn't help but smile. "When did you become such a romantic?"

"I've always been a romantic. You've just always been impossible." She grinned. "But you're not being impossible anymore, are you?"

"No," I admitted. "I'm not."

"So tell me. What happened? What changed?"

I thought about how to explain it—the rescue, the hand-holding, the conversation on the beach last night. But really, it went back further than that.

"I was wrong about him," I said finally. "For three years, I was wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"I thought he looked down on me. Thought that joke he made our first day meant he didn't respect me, didn't think I could do the job as well as a boy could." I traced patterns in the condensation on my milkshake glass. "But that's not what it was at all. He was just a scared kid trying to fit in, and he made a stupid choice. And instead of letting him apologize, I held onto my anger because—"

"Because it was safer than admitting you were attracted to him," Betty finished gently.

I looked up, surprised. "How did you know?"

"Josie, I've been your best friend since we were eight years old. I know you. And I knew from day one that your reaction to Matt was way too intense to just be about professional rivalry." She reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "You don't get that angry at someone unless they matter to you. And you spent three years being furious with him, which told me he mattered a lot."

"I didn't want him to matter."

"I know. Because if he mattered, that meant you had feelings, and feelings meant vulnerability, and vulnerability felt dangerous after losing your dad."

Tears pricked my eyes. Leave it to Betty to cut right to the heart of it. "Yeah."

"So what changed? What finally made you let him in?"

"The rescue." I told her about the child in the riptide, about working in perfect synchronization with Matt, about realizing that partnership didn't diminish my strength—it enhanced it. "We needed each other out there. And afterward, sitting on the beach, I realized that needing someone isn't weakness. It's just... being human."

Betty's eyes were suspiciously shiny. "That's beautiful, Josie."

"And then we started actually talking. Getting to know each other without all the competitive armor. And he's—" I paused, trying to find the right words. "He's kind and patient and he sees me. Really sees me. Not just the tough lifeguard exterior, but the scared girl underneath who's been hiding behind that exterior for five years."

"Do you love him?"

The question made my heart stutter. "I don't know. Maybe. It's too soon to—"

"Josie." Betty's voice was gentle but firm. "You've known him for three years. You've competed with him, worked alongside him, saved a life with him. You know him better than you want to admit. So I'll ask again: do you love him?"

I thought about Matt's smile when he saw me in the morning. The way he'd stayed beside me in dangerous water, never leaving me alone. How he'd apologized for three years without giving up. The patience in his voice when he said he'd wait as long as I needed. The faith in his eyes when he said I wasn't broken.

"Yes," I whispered. "I think I do."

Saying it out loud made it real in a way thinking it hadn't. I loved Matt Logan. Somewhere between rivalry and partnership, between competition and conversation, I'd fallen in love with him.

"Oh, Josie." Betty was definitely crying now, happy tears streaming down her face. "I'm so glad. You deserve this. You deserve to be happy."

"I'm terrified," I admitted.

"Of course you are. Love is terrifying. It means giving someone the power to hurt you." Betty squeezed my hand again. "But it also means giving someone the chance to make you happier than you've ever been. And from what I've seen, Matt would rather hurt himself than hurt you."

"He told me last night that I'm the most important person in his life."

"What did you say?"

"That he means something to me too. More than just friends." I smiled despite my fear. "We agreed to take it slow. Figure it out as we go."

"That's perfect. That's exactly right." Betty sat back, studying me with the affection of someone who'd known me half my life. "You look different, you know."

"Different how?"

"Lighter. Like you've been carrying this heavy weight for years and finally set it down." She grinned. "You look happy, Josie. Really, genuinely happy. And that makes me happy."

The bell over the door chimed, and I looked up to see Matt entering the ice cream parlor. He spotted us immediately, his face breaking into that smile that made my stomach flip.

"Speak of the devil," Betty murmured, then called out, "Matt! Come join us!"

He walked over, and I felt my heart rate kick up just at his proximity. How had I spent three years not noticing how handsome he was? How had I missed the kindness in his eyes, the warmth of his presence?

"Ladies," he said, sliding into the booth next to me. Close enough that our arms touched. "Talking about me?"

"Always," Betty said cheerfully. "I was just telling Josie how much better you two look now that you've stopped being ridiculous."

Matt laughed. "We were pretty ridiculous, weren't we?"

"Catastrophically ridiculous," Betty agreed. "But you've redeemed yourselves. So I'm officially giving you my blessing."

"We don't need your blessing," I protested.

"Yes, you do. Best friend privileges. And you have it. Matt, you're officially approved." Betty stood, gathering her apron. "Break's over. I have to get back to work. You two enjoy your afternoon."

After she left, Matt looked at me with amusement. "I've been officially approved."

"She takes her best friend duties very seriously."

"I respect that." His expression softened. "How are you doing? After last night?"

"Good. Confused, terrified, happy—all at once."

"That sounds about right." Matt reached under the table and found my hand, twining our fingers together. The touch sent warmth through me. "I meant what I said. We'll figure this out together."

"I told Betty I love you."

The words tumbled out before I could stop them, raw and honest and utterly vulnerable. Matt went still, his hand tightening around mine.

"You told Betty?" His voice was careful, like he was afraid to hope.

"She asked. And I—" I took a breath, gathering courage. "I realized it was true. I don't know when it happened exactly. Maybe it's been happening all along, underneath the rivalry and the competition. But Matt, I love you."

His eyes were bright with emotion. "Josie—"

"I'm still scared. I'm still figuring out how to be vulnerable without feeling weak. But I needed you to know. Because you've been honest with me, and I owe you the same honesty back."

Matt cupped my face with his free hand, thumb brushing my cheekbone. "I love you too. I've loved you since our first summer, when you beat my swim time and looked so fiercely triumphant. I've loved you through every competition, every argument, every moment we pushed each other to be better. And I love you now, knowing we finally stopped fighting and started really seeing each other."

Tears spilled over, and I didn't try to stop them. "We wasted so much time."

"No, we didn't. We needed that time. We needed to become who we are now before we could do this." He leaned his forehead against mine. "Every moment led us here. To this booth, this conversation, this truth."

"I want to kiss you," I whispered.

"Then kiss me."

I did.

It was my first kiss, and it was perfect—soft and sweet and full of three years of tension finally released. Matt's lips were gentle, his hand cradling my face like I was something precious. The kiss tasted like strawberry milkshakes and promise and everything I'd been too afraid to want.

When we pulled apart, both of us were smiling.

"Wow," Matt said.

"Yeah."

"We should probably do that again sometime."

"Definitely."

We sat there in the booth, hands clasped, foreheads touching, grinning like idiots. Through the window, I could see Betty watching from behind the counter, her hand over her heart, tears streaming down her face in happiness.

My best friend, who'd waited three years for this moment. Who'd known before I did that Matt Logan was someone worth letting in.

"Thank you," I said to Matt.

"For what?"

"For waiting. For being patient. For not giving up on me even when I was impossible."

"You were never impossible. Just scared. And that's okay." He kissed my forehead. "I'd wait three more years if that's what you needed."

"You won't have to. I'm done running."

"Good. Because I'm done chasing. From now on, we walk together."

"Partners?"

"Partners," he agreed. "In everything."

We finished our milkshakes and walked back to the beach hand in hand, not caring who saw, not hiding what we'd become. The crew would definitely notice—Danny would collect his bet winnings, Linda would roll her eyes, Captain Ed would probably have something wise to say about timing and maturity.

But I didn't care. Because for the first time in five years, since my father died and I'd built walls around my heart, I felt truly free.

Free to love. Free to be vulnerable. Free to trust that Matt would catch me if I fell.

And the most amazing part? I trusted him. Completely.

That was the real victory—not the trophy I was still training to win, not proving I was the best lifeguard on the crew. The victory was learning that I could be strong and in love simultaneously. That vulnerability wasn't weakness but courage.

That Matt Logan, the boy I'd spent three years pushing away, was exactly the person I needed to pull close.

As we reached the beach, Matt squeezed my hand. "Ready to face the crew's inevitable teasing?"

"With you? Yeah. I'm ready."

And I was.
