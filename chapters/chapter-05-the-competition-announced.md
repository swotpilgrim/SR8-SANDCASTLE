# Chapter 5: The Competition Announced

Friday afternoon, Captain Ed called a special crew meeting during shift change. The timing was deliberate—he wanted both morning and afternoon guards present, which meant something important was happening.

We gathered in a semicircle around the lifeguard station, the June sun warm on our shoulders, the sound of waves providing constant background rhythm. I stood toward the front, as usual. Matt stood a few feet to my left, also toward the front. We hadn't spoken much since Wednesday's drills, but something had eased between us—not friendship exactly, but a reduction in hostility. Less sharp edges.

Captain Ed held his clipboard like a battle plan, and his expression carried that particular mix of authority and anticipation that meant he was about to challenge us.

"All right, listen up," he began. "It's time to talk about the annual Marina Bay Beach Lifeguard Competition."

A ripple of excitement moved through the crew. The new guards looked curious. The returning guards looked competitive. Linda's eyes lit up. Danny grinned at Matt, who maintained a neutral expression I recognized as carefully controlled anticipation.

My own heart rate kicked up.

The competition. I'd been waiting for this announcement since the first day of summer.

"For those who are new," Captain Ed continued, "this competition has been a Marina Bay tradition for eight years. Last weekend before Labor Day—that's August twenty-fourth this year—we run a comprehensive test of all lifeguarding skills. Swimming speed, rescue techniques, endurance, first aid knowledge, and teamwork. Two full days of challenges."

He paused, letting that sink in. "The winner receives the Marina Bay Lifeguard Trophy, which goes on permanent display at the community center with their name engraved. They also get featured in the local newspaper and recognition at the town council meeting."

Public recognition. Permanent record. Proof—undeniable, official proof—that you were the best.

I wanted it like I wanted air.

"Past winners," Captain Ed said, consulting his clipboard, "include Rick Morrison in fifty-four and fifty-five, and Matt Logan in fifty-five and fifty-six."

My jaw tightened. Of course Matt had won. Twice. The first summer when I was still new, still finding my footing. The second when I'd come in second place by a margin close enough to taste.

This year would be different.

"Competition is open to all returning guards with at least one full summer of experience," Captain Ed explained. "New recruits, you'll assist with logistics and observation. Consider it training for next year."

One of the new guards raised his hand. "What kind of challenges, sir?"

"Everything you've trained for. Timed swims at various distances. Rescue scenarios with actors playing victims in different conditions. First aid response to simulated emergencies. Endurance tests. And partner challenges that require coordination and communication." Captain Ed's eyes swept across us. "This competition pushes you to your limits. It's not just about being fast or strong. It's about being the complete lifeguard."

Danny spoke up. "Team challenges are paired randomly?"

"Drawn from a hat on competition day. You need to be able to work with anyone." Captain Ed's gaze lingered on Matt and me for a fraction of a second. "Adaptability matters as much as skill."

The message was clear—our rivalry needed to stay professional.

"You have nine weeks to train," Captain Ed said. "I'll post the detailed event list and rules next week. Use your off-hours wisely. Come competition day, I expect Marina Bay's best."

He dismissed the meeting, and immediately the crew erupted into excited conversation. Guards clustered in groups, discussing strategy, making predictions, sizing up their competition.

I stood still, processing. Nine weeks. Nine weeks to train, to prepare, to make sure that this year—this year—I would win.

"Looks like we're doing this again."

Matt's voice, close to my left shoulder. I turned to find him watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Not hostile. Not friendly. Something evaluating.

"Looks like it," I agreed.

"You planning to win this year?"

"Absolutely."

The corner of his mouth quirked. "So am I."

"Then may the best lifeguard win." I extended my hand formally, the way I'd seen athletes do before competitions, the way Captain Ed had taught us to show respect even in rivalry.

Matt looked at my hand for a moment, then grasped it. His palm was warm and calloused from rope work and swimming. The handshake was firm, neither dominating nor yielding. We held the contact for a beat longer than necessary, eyes locked.

Something electric passed through that handshake—awareness, challenge, recognition. For a moment the beach fell away and it was just the two of us, competitors and equals, about to spend nine weeks pushing each other toward excellence.

Then I pulled my hand back and the moment broke.

"Good luck, Logan."

"You too, Carter."

Linda approached as Matt walked away, her expression a mix of excitement and calculation. "This is going to be intense. You and Matt competing head-to-head again."

"We've been competing all summer," I pointed out. "This just makes it official."

"True." Linda hesitated, then added, "You know everyone assumes it'll come down to you two, right? Like, the rest of us are basically competing for third place."

"Don't sell yourself short. You're good."

"I'm decent. You two are... something else." She shook her head. "Just promise me you won't actually kill each other over this trophy."

"No promises."

She laughed, but I wasn't entirely joking.

That evening at the boarding house, I told my mother about the competition over dinner. She listened with her usual patient attention, passing me the bowl of green beans and studying my face.

"You're very focused on this," she observed.

"It's important."

"Why?"

I looked up, surprised by the question. "Because it proves I'm the best lifeguard."

"To whom?"

"To... everyone. To Captain Ed. To the crew. To myself."

My mother set down her fork, her expression gentle but probing. "Josie, you're already an excellent lifeguard. Captain Ed sings your praises constantly. Your crew respects you. You know your own abilities. Who, specifically, do you need to prove something to?"

The answer rose unbidden: Matt Logan.

I needed to prove to him that I was better, that his joke three years ago had been wrong, that I wasn't someone to be dismissed or condescended to. I needed to beat him definitively, publicly, officially.

But I couldn't say that to my mother, so I deflected. "It's about personal achievement. Being the best version of myself."

"Mm-hmm." My mother's tone suggested she saw right through me. "And does Matt Logan factor into this personal achievement?"

"He's my main competition, so obviously he's relevant."

"I mean, does your determination to win have anything to do with Matt specifically, rather than the trophy itself?"

I shifted uncomfortably. "Why would you ask that?"

"Because you get a particular tone in your voice when you talk about him. Very... intense."

"He's intensely annoying."

"Is he?" My mother sipped her water, choosing words carefully. "Or is he intensely something else that you're calling annoying because it's safer?"

"Mom."

"I'm just observing that you've spent three summers competing with this young man, and that competition seems to drive you more than anything else in your life." Her eyes were kind but knowing. "Sometimes we focus on people who challenge us in ways we're not ready to examine."

I stood, carrying my plate to the sink. "I'm focused on winning the competition. That's all."

"If you say so, sweetheart."

But her words followed me upstairs to my bedroom, where I sat by the window overlooking the ocean and tried not to think about what she'd implied.

Did I care about beating Matt more than I cared about the trophy itself?

Yes.

Was that because of the joke, the rivalry, the need to prove myself?

Partially.

Or was it because—as my mother and Betty both seemed to think—Matt Logan meant something more to me than I was willing to admit?

I pulled out a notebook and started making training plans, pushing the uncomfortable questions aside. Nine weeks. I needed a structured approach: swimming drills for speed and endurance, rescue technique practice, first aid review, endurance conditioning.

I was sketching out a weekly schedule when I realized I was incorporating Matt into my planning. Assuming he'd be training at the same times, in the same locations. Using him as my benchmark, my measuring stick, my motivation.

When had he become so central to everything I did?

The thought unsettled me enough that I closed the notebook and got ready for bed, but sleep was elusive. I lay awake thinking about Matt's expression when we'd shaken hands, the electric awareness in that contact, the way he'd looked at me like he saw through all my defenses to something underneath.

Nine weeks of training together. Nine weeks of competition. Nine weeks of constant proximity to someone who seemed to see me more clearly than I wanted to be seen.

I told myself it was about the trophy. About proving myself. About being the best.

But lying there in the dark, honest in the way only solitude allowed, I had to admit: some part of me was looking forward to those nine weeks. Looking forward to pushing myself against Matt's matched abilities. Looking forward to the challenge he presented.

And that realization scared me more than any competition ever could.

Because wanting to beat Matt Logan was safe and familiar. Wanting to be near him was something else entirely—something I'd spent three years carefully not acknowledging.

I turned toward the window, watching moonlight silver the waves, and wondered what would happen if I stopped running from whatever this was between us. Would I find an enemy? A rival? Or something I wasn't ready to name?

The ocean offered no answers, and eventually I drifted into restless sleep, dreaming of races I couldn't win and hands I couldn't let go of, and Matt Logan's eyes seeing everything I tried to hide.
