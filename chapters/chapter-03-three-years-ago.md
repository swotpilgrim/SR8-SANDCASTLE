# Chapter 3: Three Years Ago

I couldn't sleep that night.

My window faced the ocean, and the sound of waves usually lulled me into easy dreams. But Tuesday night I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, replaying every interaction with Matt Logan. Every barbed comment, every competitive glance, every moment of awareness that felt like static electricity crackling between us.

Betty's question echoed in my head: *Do you even remember why you don't like him?*

I did remember. Of course I did.

But lying there in the dark, the memory felt less sharp than it should. Like something worn smooth by three years of handling, the edges dulled, the original shape changed into something else entirely.

I closed my eyes and let myself drift back.

**June 1954**

I was fifteen years old and terrified.

Not that I showed it. I walked onto Marina Bay Beach that first morning with my chin up, wearing the red lifeguard swimsuit that felt too grown-up and too revealing. My certification card sat in my canvas bag like proof I belonged here.

But I was still the youngest guard on the crew. And one of only two girls.

The other guards were already gathered near the station when I arrived—boys ranging from sixteen to nineteen, tanned and confident, joking and shoving each other with easy familiarity. They looked like they belonged. Like the beach was theirs.

I'd had to fight for every inch of space I occupied.

Captain Ed Morrison spotted me hovering at the edge of the group and waved me over. "Listen up! We've got two new guards joining us this summer. This is Josie Carter—youngest person to pass the Marina Bay certification in five years, top marks in both swimming and rescue technique."

Every head turned toward me. I felt the weight of their assessment, the skepticism in some eyes, the surprise in others. A girl. A young girl. Could she really pull a panicking adult from rough surf? Could she really keep up during emergency response?

I lifted my chin higher.

"And this is Matt Logan," Captain Ed continued, gesturing to a boy who'd just jogged up to the group. "Also new this summer, strong swimming background, good instincts."

Matt Logan was sixteen, tall and lanky in the way of boys who hadn't quite grown into their height yet. His dark hair was wind-tousled, his smile quick and nervous. He gave a little wave to the crew, and several of the older guards clapped him on the shoulder in welcome.

I noticed the difference immediately. They welcomed him. They were assessing me.

"Carter, you'll be training with Morrison on stand techniques this morning," Captain Ed said. "Logan, you're with Sullivan on water protocols. Questions?"

I shook my head. Matt said, "No, sir."

"Good. Let's get to work."

The crew dispersed to their assignments. I was turning to follow Captain Ed when one of the older guards—I'd later learn his name was Rick—called out loudly enough for everyone to hear.

"Hey, Logan! Hope the girl lifeguard can keep up with the rest of us!"

Laughter rippled through the group. Not mean-spirited exactly, but not kind either. The kind of laughter that said they weren't taking me seriously, that this was funny, that a girl thinking she could do this job was somehow amusing.

My face burned.

And then Matt Logan—nervous, new, trying-to-fit-in Matt Logan—laughed too.

"Guess we'll find out," he said, grinning at Rick like they were sharing a joke. Like I was the joke.

Something crystallized in my chest. Something hard and cold and absolutely determined.

I turned without a word and walked toward Captain Ed, my vision narrowed to a single point of focus: I would prove every single one of them wrong. Especially Matt Logan, who'd used me as a punchline to buy himself acceptance with the older guards.

That morning, I trained harder than I'd ever trained in my life. Captain Ed ran me through stand protocols, emergency signals, water scanning techniques, jurisdiction boundaries. I absorbed every word, asked sharp questions, demonstrated perfect form. When he sent me up the practice stand, I climbed faster than any of the new male guards.

"You've got good instincts, Carter," Captain Ed said approvingly. "Keep this up and you'll be one of my best."

I would be the best. Not one of. The actual best.

At lunch, the other female lifeguard—a college girl named Sarah who was in her third summer—pulled me aside.

"Don't let them get to you," she said gently. "They always question the girls at first. You just have to prove yourself, and then they'll come around."

I appreciated her kindness, but I didn't want them to come around. I wanted them to eat their words.

The afternoon brought swimming trials—timed laps to establish our baseline speeds for the season records. All the guards lined up at the water's edge while Captain Ed stood with his stopwatch.

Matt Logan went first among the new guards. He dove cleanly and swam hard, his form good but not exceptional. His time was solid—respectable for a sixteen-year-old boy.

Then it was my turn.

I stood at the water's edge, feeling every eye on me. Feeling Matt Logan's gaze especially, wondering if he was laughing again, if he was expecting me to struggle.

Captain Ed's whistle blew.

I dove.

The water closed around me like coming home. This was where I was strong, where I was fast, where no one could question my competence. I swam like I was racing for my life, arms cutting through water, legs kicking in perfect rhythm, lungs burning but controlled.

When I touched the finish marker and surfaced, Captain Ed was staring at his stopwatch.

"Carter. Time?"

"Yes, sir?"

"You just beat the returning guards' average by three seconds."

Silence on the beach. Then one of the older guards whistled, impressed.

"And you beat Logan's time by four seconds."

I didn't look at Matt. I climbed out of the water and walked back to the lineup, water streaming off my shoulders, and stood at attention like Captain Ed hadn't just confirmed what I already knew: I was faster than the boy who'd laughed at me.

Over the following weeks, the pattern established itself. Matt and I were assigned the same training sessions, constantly compared and measured against each other. The crew started betting on our times.

And Matt competed right back. Every time I swam faster, he trained harder. Every time I perfected a rescue technique, he matched it.

About a month into that first summer, he tried to apologize.

We were both assigned to equipment maintenance—tedious work cleaning and inventorying rescue buoys, first aid supplies, stand equipment. The other guards had scattered to their various tasks, leaving Matt and I alone in the storage shed.

"Hey, Josie," he said, his voice uncertain.

I didn't look up from the rescue buoy I was inspecting. "It's Carter."

"Right. Carter." He cleared his throat. "I wanted to say... that first day, when Rick made that comment about you keeping up? I shouldn't have laughed. It was stupid."

Now I did look up, meeting his eyes directly. "Yes, it was."

"I was just trying to—"

"Fit in with the older guys? Make them like you? I know exactly what you were doing."

He flinched. "It wasn't personal."

"It was to me."

"I didn't mean it like that. I think you're actually a really good—"

"I don't care what you think." I stood, shouldering past him toward the door. "We're colleagues, Logan. That's all we need to be."

"But—"

"Drop it."

He did. But the pattern was set.

For the rest of that summer, Matt Logan tried periodically to be friendly—offering compliments on my rescues, attempting casual conversation, suggesting we train together cooperatively instead of competitively. I shut him down every time.

I told myself it was about the joke, about his condescension. But maybe, even then, there was something else underneath. Something I wasn't ready to examine.

The crew learned quickly that Josie and Matt were rivals, not friends. That putting us on the same shift meant electric competition and spectacular performance. That we brought out the best in each other's abilities and the worst in each other's attitudes.

By August of that first summer, we were legendary. The girl and the boy who couldn't stand each other but couldn't seem to stay away from each other either.

Summer ended. Matt went back to Philadelphia. I stayed in Marina Bay, returning to high school and counting days until the next summer when I could prove myself all over again.

He came back the following June. And the June after that.

Three summers of competition. Three summers of rivalry. Three summers of holding onto that initial hurt like armor against something I couldn't name.

I opened my eyes to my dark bedroom, the memory fading but not gone.

Three years since that first day. Three years since Matt Logan had laughed at a joke made at my expense.

Did he even remember it the same way I did? Did he remember it at all?

Betty's question haunted me: *Do you even remember why you don't like him?*

I remembered the joke. I remembered the laughter. I remembered the humiliation.

But lying there in the dark, honest with myself in a way I couldn't be in daylight, I had to admit something else: I remembered how hard Matt had tried to apologize. How many times he'd attempted friendly conversation that I'd shut down. How often he'd looked at me with something that wasn't condescension at all, but confusion and maybe even hurt.

What if I'd been wrong?

What if that joke—stupid and thoughtless and hurtful as it was—had been exactly what Matt claimed: a nervous sixteen-year-old boy trying to fit in, not thinking about how his words would land?

What if I'd built three years of antagonism on a foundation that didn't deserve it?

The thought was uncomfortable, unwelcome. It was easier to hold onto anger, easier to keep Matt at arm's length through competition and hostility, easier to maintain the walls I'd built after my father died.

Easier, but maybe not right.

I turned toward the window, watching moonlight silver the ocean waves. Tomorrow I'd wake up and go back to the beach and trade barbs with Matt Logan like always. The rivalry was familiar, safe, uncomplicated.

But tonight, for the first time in three years, I let myself wonder: what if I'd been wrong about him all along?

The ocean offered no answers, just the steady rhythm of waves against shore. Some patterns ran too deep to easily change.

I fell asleep to that rhythm, dreaming of that first summer—not the humiliation, but the moment in the water when everything else fell away and I was simply, perfectly fast. And somewhere behind me, matching my pace stroke for stroke, was a boy who might not have been laughing at all.
