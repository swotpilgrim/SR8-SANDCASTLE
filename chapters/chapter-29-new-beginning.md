# Chapter 29: New Beginning

The last days of August passed in a blur of happiness.

Matt and I worked our shifts side by side, the partnership we'd briefly had after the rescue now permanent and easy. The crew teased us mercilessly but fondly. Betty kept making elaborate wedding plans despite our protests. Danny started a betting pool on how long until Matt proposed—Captain Ed shut that down immediately, but not before half the crew had placed bets.

Thursday evening, Matt's mother invited me to dinner to meet his family. I spent an hour picking out an outfit—nothing too fancy, nothing too casual, something that said "I'm serious about your son but not trying too hard."

Matt picked me up at six, grinning at my obvious nervousness.

"They're going to love you," he assured me.

"You don't know that."

"I do. My mother already likes you based on what I've told her. The boys will be impressed that you're a lifeguard. You'll be fine."

His house was a modest two-story in a neighborhood full of families. The yard had a basketball hoop and scattered toys. Through the window I could see people moving around—a warm, lively household.

Matt squeezed my hand. "Ready?"

"No. But let's go anyway."

The moment we walked in, I was surrounded. Three boys descended immediately—Tommy showing off his baseball trophy, Kevin asking if it was true I could swim a mile without stopping, Jamie trying to sell me a "genuine diamond ring" that was clearly from a gumball machine.

"Boys, give Josie some breathing room," Matt's mother said, emerging from the kitchen. She was petite and warm, with Matt's eyes and a welcoming smile. "I'm Margaret. It's wonderful to finally meet you."

"Thank you for having me, Mrs. Logan."

"Please, call me Margaret." She pulled me into a hug. "Any girl who can get through my son's stubbornness is welcome here anytime."

"Mom," Matt protested.

"It's true. You mooned over this girl for three years." But she was smiling fondly at him.

Dinner was chaotic and wonderful—everyone talking over each other, Tommy and Kevin arguing about sports, Jamie trying to trade his vegetables for dessert before the meal even started. Matt's father sat at the head of the table, quieter than the others, but his eyes were kind.

"So you're a lifeguard," he said to me. "That's admirable work. Dangerous sometimes."

"Yes, sir. But worth it."

"Matt tells us you saved a little boy from a riptide. That you and my son worked together perfectly."

I glanced at Matt, who was watching me with a soft expression. "We did. Your son is an excellent lifeguard. Excellent partner too."

"He's learned a lot from you, I think. Competition pushed him to be better."

"We pushed each other. Made each other stronger."

Margaret smiled. "That's what good partners do. Robert and I have been married twenty years, and we still push each other to be better every day."

After dinner, the boys dragged Matt outside to play basketball while I helped Margaret with dishes.

"Thank you for being patient with Matt," she said as we worked. "When he first came home this summer and told me about you—about the three-year grudge and how much he liked you anyway—I worried. I didn't want to see him hurt."

"I'm sorry I hurt him. I was scared and stubborn and—"

"And human. We're all scared sometimes, Josie. The important thing is you figured it out. You chose to be brave." She handed me a dish to dry. "Matt's father has a heart condition. We don't talk about it much, but we all know—his time is limited. Could be years, could be decades. We don't know."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. We choose to love each other anyway. Choose to build a life knowing it might end too soon. Because the alternative—not loving him to protect myself from eventual loss—that would be a worse life." She looked at me seriously. "I think you understand that now. Matt says you lost your father young."

"When I was twelve. He drowned."

"And you became a lifeguard. Faced the thing that hurt you so you could save others from the same loss."

"I suppose so. I never thought of it that way."

"That's courage, Josie. Real courage isn't the absence of fear. It's facing the fear anyway." She squeezed my shoulder. "You're good for my son. He's happy in a way I haven't seen before. So thank you."

"He's good for me too. Makes me braver."

Through the window, I watched Matt playing with his brothers—laughing, competitive but gentle, clearly adored by all three boys. This was the life he'd grown up in. The family that had taught him patience and kindness and how to love without reservation.

I wanted to build something like this with him someday. Wanted the chaos and warmth and love that filled this house.

We left around nine, Matt's brothers extracting promises that I'd come to Tommy's baseball game and teach Kevin to swim better and let Jamie show me his rock collection.

In the car, Matt took my hand. "See? They loved you."

"Your mother is wonderful. Your brothers are exhausting but sweet. Your father is kind."

"They're good people. Taught me everything I know about family, partnership, love." He paused. "My dad's sick. Did my mom tell you?"

"She mentioned it. I'm sorry."

"Me too. But also—watching them together, seeing how my mother loves him despite knowing she might lose him—that's taught me more about courage than anything else. She chooses him every day, even scared. That's what real love looks like."

"It is. And that's what I want to be for you. Someone who chooses you every day, even when it's scary."

"You already are."

Friday brought more perfect beach weather. The storm had cleared, leaving everything bright and clean. Families packed the sand, making the most of the last weekend before Labor Day.

During lunch break, Betty appeared with ice cream cones.

"Celebration," she announced. "For my best friend finally getting her head out of her stubborn rear end and dating the boy who's perfect for her."

"You have such a way with words," I said, accepting the cone.

"It's a gift." She sat down beside me, watching the ocean. "You're happy. Really happy. I can see it."

"I am. Terrified sometimes, but happy."

"Good. That's how it should be. Happy and terrified all at once." She bumped my shoulder. "I'm proud of you, Jos. You were so scared after your dad died. Closed off to everyone. And now look at you—in love, vulnerable, letting someone in. That takes guts."

"I had good friends pushing me."

"You had good friends who loved you enough to be honest when you were being an idiot." She grinned. "But you did the hard work. You chose to be brave. That's all you, not us."

Saturday evening, the crew gathered for an end-of-season bonfire. Labor Day weekend meant the end of summer—guards would scatter back to college or jobs, the beach would quiet, the season would officially close.

Matt and I sat together on a blanket, his arm around my shoulders, watching flames dance against the darkening sky. Around us, the crew laughed and told stories about the summer—rescues, difficult families, the competition that had ended in an unprecedented tie.

"Remember when Carter and Logan hated each other?" Danny said, grinning at us. "Seems like a lifetime ago."

"We didn't hate each other," I protested. "It was... complicated."

"You threw a rescue buoy at his head."

"That was an accident!"

"Sure it was." But Danny was smiling. "Seriously though, you two are great together. Made the whole crew better this summer. That rescue with the little boy? That was teamwork at its finest."

Captain Ed raised his bottle in toast. "To partnerships that make us stronger. To courage in the face of danger—both in the water and in the heart. To a summer well spent."

"To summer," the crew echoed.

Matt leaned close and whispered, "To you. For finally letting me in."

"To us," I whispered back. "For figuring it out together."

The bonfire burned low as night deepened. One by one, crew members said their goodbyes—heading home, making plans to stay in touch, promising to return next summer. The season was ending.

But for Matt and me, something was just beginning.

"Tomorrow's Labor Day," Matt said as the fire turned to embers. "Last official day of summer."

"I know. Then you leave for Rutgers, I start applying to colleges, we figure out long distance."

"Scared?"

"Terrified. But also—" I looked at him. "Also certain. We'll figure it out because we're partners. Because I choose you and you choose me and that's what matters."

"That's exactly what matters." He kissed me, soft and sweet. "We've got this, Josie. Whatever comes next, we've got it together."

And looking at him—this boy who'd waited three years, who'd forgiven my fear, who'd taught me that vulnerability was strength—I believed him.

We had this.

We had each other.

And that was more than enough.
