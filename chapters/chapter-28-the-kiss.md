# Chapter 28: The Kiss

Wednesday brought rain—a rare summer storm that rolled in from the ocean and kept most families away from the beach. The lifeguard crew still reported for duty, but with rough surf and empty sand, it was more observation than active rescue work.

Matt and I sat on our adjacent stands under gray skies, watching waves crash with more force than usual. The wind whipped my hair around my face. Salt spray carried on the breeze.

"Remember that first rescue?" Matt called across the space between stands. "The little boy in the riptide?"

"How could I forget? That was the day everything changed."

"That was the day I realized we were meant to be partners." He smiled. "Took you a bit longer to figure it out."

"I was stubborn."

"You were scared. But you got there eventually."

Around noon, Captain Ed sent everyone home early. "No point keeping full crew in this weather. Carter, Logan—you two can secure the stands and lock up. Everyone else, dismissed."

The crew scattered gratefully, leaving Matt and me alone on the deserted beach. We climbed down from our stands and began the process of securing equipment for the storm—pulling in rescue boards, checking rope lines, making sure everything was tied down properly.

"I love this," Matt said as we worked. "The beach in bad weather. It's beautiful in a different way."

He was right. The gray sky and rough surf had a wild beauty—powerful and untamed. The ocean showing its strength.

"It's honest," I said. "The ocean doesn't pretend to be safe. It's dangerous and everyone knows it. There's something refreshing about that."

"Is that why you became a lifeguard? Because you respect the danger?"

"Partly. And partly because—" I paused, thinking about it. "Because understanding danger makes you braver. I watched my father drown because nobody understood the risk. Nobody was there to save him. I learned to swim and became a lifeguard so I could understand the danger and face it anyway."

"That's courageous."

"So is what you've done. Loving someone who kept pushing you away for three years. That takes a different kind of courage."

Matt finished tying down the last rescue board and turned to me. "Maybe we're both brave in different ways. You with the ocean, me with my heart. And now you're learning to be brave with your heart too."

"Thanks to you."

"Thanks to you choosing to try." He stepped closer, rain starting to fall harder. "Come on, let's get inside before we're soaked."

We ran toward the lifeguard station, laughing as the rain intensified. By the time we reached the covered porch, we were both drenched. I wiped water from my face, shivering slightly.

"Cold?" Matt asked.

"A little."

He pulled me close, wrapping his arms around me. His warmth seeped through my wet uniform. I rested my head against his chest, listening to his steady heartbeat, feeling safe despite the storm raging around us.

"I have something I've been wanting to ask you," Matt said after a moment.

"Okay."

"That night at the marina, when I asked if I could kiss you and you ran away—" He paused. "Can I try again? Can I ask again?"

My heart raced. This was the moment I'd run from before. The moment that had sent me spiraling into panic and fear.

But I wasn't that scared girl anymore.

"Yes," I said, looking up at him. "Yes, you can ask."

Matt smiled—nervous and hopeful and tender all at once. He brought his hand up to cup my face, thumb brushing my cheekbone exactly like he'd done at the marina.

"Josie Carter," he said softly. "Can I kiss you?"

This time, I didn't hesitate. This time, I didn't feel panic or fear or the urge to run.

I felt ready.

"Yes," I whispered. "Please."

Matt leaned down slowly, giving me time to change my mind if I wanted to. But I didn't want to. I stretched up to meet him halfway, and then his lips were on mine and everything else disappeared.

The kiss was gentle at first—sweet and careful, like he was still afraid I might bolt. But when I kissed him back, wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him closer, he deepened the kiss. His hands tangled in my wet hair. My heart hammered against my ribs. Rain pounded on the roof above us.

When we finally broke apart, both breathless, Matt rested his forehead against mine.

"Was that okay?" he asked.

"That was perfect. That was—" I laughed shakily. "That was worth waiting for."

"Three years worth?"

"At least three years worth."

He kissed me again, longer this time, and I felt all the walls I'd built over five years crumbling completely. Felt the fear that had controlled me for so long finally releasing its grip. Felt myself opening up to possibility and hope and love without reservation.

When we broke apart the second time, I was crying.

"What's wrong?" Matt asked immediately, concerned.

"Nothing's wrong. Everything's right." I wiped at my face. "I'm just—I'm so glad I didn't run away. I'm so glad I came back to the marina that morning. I'm so glad you gave me another chance."

"Me too." He kissed my forehead. "Me too, Josie."

We stood there on the porch for a long time, wrapped in each other's arms, watching the storm. The rain showed no signs of stopping. The ocean churned gray and violent. Lightning flashed in the distance.

"My mother will be worried," I said eventually, though I didn't move.

"Probably. Mine too. I should call them." But he didn't let go of me.

"Five more minutes?"

"Five more minutes."

We stayed like that—holding each other while the storm raged—and I thought about how different this was from the marina. How that night I'd felt only panic when Matt tried to kiss me. How I'd run away because vulnerability felt like drowning.

Now vulnerability felt like breathing.

"What are you thinking about?" Matt asked.

"About how scared I was at the marina. About how different I feel now."

"What changed?"

"I did. I stopped trying to protect myself from potential pain and started accepting that pain is part of love. That risk is part of connection. That needing someone doesn't make me weak—it makes me human."

"That's a big change."

"I had good teachers. You, mostly. Showing me patience and forgiveness. But also my mother, Captain Ed, Betty. Everyone trying to tell me what I was too stubborn to hear."

"And what was that?"

"That love is worth the risk. That partnership is stronger than independence. That being vulnerable takes more courage than building walls." I pulled back to look at him. "That you were worth fighting for."

Matt's expression softened completely. "I love you so much, Josie. Sometimes I can't believe this is real. That you're finally letting me in. That we're finally here."

"I love you too. And this is real. We're real." I kissed him again, feeling the truth of it. "And I'm not running anymore. I promise."

"I know. I trust you."

Those three words—*I trust you*—meant more than anything else he could have said. Trust wasn't given easily, especially after I'd broken it by running away. But he trusted me now. Believed in me. Believed in us.

I wouldn't take that gift lightly.

The rain finally started to ease around two o'clock. We called our mothers from the station phone to let them know we were safe. Mine sounded relieved but unsurprised that I'd been with Matt. His mother invited me to dinner that weekend to meet the whole family.

"Fair warning," Matt said after he hung up. "My brothers can be a lot. Tommy will challenge you to every sport imaginable. Kevin will ask you a thousand questions. Jamie will try to con you into something."

"I can handle it."

"I know you can. You're the bravest person I know."

We locked up the lifeguard station and walked to Matt's car, still hand in hand. The storm was passing, leaving everything washed clean and fresh. The beach looked different after rain—darker sand, foam on the waves, pieces of shells and seaweed scattered by wind.

Before we got in the car, Matt pulled me close for one more kiss.

"Thank you," he said.

"For what?"

"For saying yes when I asked to kiss you. For not running away. For being brave enough to let this happen." He smiled. "For everything."

"Thank you for waiting. For asking again. For giving me another chance when I didn't deserve it."

"You deserved it. You always deserved it. You just needed time to believe it yourself."

Driving home through rain-wet streets with Matt's hand in mine, I felt complete in a way I never had before. Not because I needed him to be whole—I was whole on my own. But because choosing to let him in made me more fully myself. More honest. More brave. More willing to risk hurt for the possibility of happiness.

The rain had washed the beach clean.

And maybe it had washed me clean too—washing away fear and walls and the belief that strength meant being alone.

Leaving me open to the scary, beautiful possibility of love.

And I was finally ready for it.

Ready for all of it.

Ready for Matt.
