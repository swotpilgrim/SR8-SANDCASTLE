# Chapter 25: Matt's Truth

The shift that day was the longest seven hours of my summer.

I sat on stand three scanning the water, but my mind was entirely on Matt. He was on stand four again, back in his familiar spot, focused on his job with that intense concentration I'd always admired.

We didn't speak beyond necessary work communication.

"Swimmer drifting north."

"I see them."

Professional. Efficient. Nothing like the easy partnership we'd had before.

The beach was packed with families enjoying the last holiday. Children built sandcastles. Teenagers played volleyball. Normal end-of-summer joy, while I sat counting minutes until I'd know whether Matt had decided to forgive me or let me go.

Betty appeared during lunch break with sandwiches.

"You're torturing yourself," she observed.

"He wants to talk after shift. At our spot by the jetty. That could mean anything, Betty. He could be planning to tell me he's done waiting. That I hurt him too many times. That—"

"Or he could be planning to tell you he forgives you and wants to try again." Betty squeezed my shoulder. "Stop assuming the worst. Matt's been in love with you for three years. That doesn't just disappear in one week."

"Love can disappear when someone hurts you badly enough."

"Then you'll find out in a few hours. But Josie? I've watched you two all summer. The way he looks at you when you're not paying attention? That's not someone who's planning to walk away."

I wanted to believe her. Desperately wanted to believe that Matt's week away had softened his hurt instead of hardening his heart.

The afternoon dragged endlessly. I helped a kid with a scraped knee. Directed a lost family to the boardwalk. Watched the ocean and tried not to watch Matt and failed constantly.

Around three, Danny climbed up to Matt's stand. They talked for several minutes, Danny glancing over at me. Finally Danny clapped Matt on the shoulder and climbed back down.

What had they been discussing?

Finally, shift ended at five. Families began packing up. Guards started their end-of-day routines—securing equipment, logging final notes.

Matt climbed down from stand four and walked toward the equipment shed without looking at me. My stomach twisted. Was he leaving?

Then I saw him emerge with two bottles of Coca-Cola and walk toward the jetty.

Our spot. He was heading to our spot.

I finished securing my stand with shaking hands, grabbed my bag, and followed.

The jetty stretched into the ocean, large rocks providing a natural barrier against waves and erosion. We'd sat here after the rescue, when everything between us started changing. When I'd first told him about my father. When I'd first felt the walls I'd built so carefully starting to crack.

Matt sat on our usual rock, two Coke bottles beside him, staring out at the ocean. The evening sun painted everything golden—sand, water, his profile. He looked tired and thoughtful and heartbreakingly handsome.

I approached slowly, giving him time to change his mind if he wanted to.

He didn't.

"Hey," he said when I reached the jetty.

"Hey." I sat on the rock beside him, leaving respectful space between us. Not touching. Not assuming. "You brought Cokes."

"Seemed appropriate. This is where we had our first real conversation. After the rescue." He handed me one of the bottles. "Felt right to have this conversation here too."

I took the Coke with trembling hands. "I'm listening."

Matt was quiet for a long moment, watching the waves roll in. Then he spoke.

"I've been thinking all week. About what you said at the marina. About us. About whether I can trust you not to run again the next time things get scary."

My heart hammered. "And?"

"And I realized something." He turned to look at me directly, his expression serious. "I've been vulnerable with you for three years, Josie. Every time I tried to apologize for that stupid joke. Every time I competed against you while secretly wanting you. Every time I let you push me away and still came back hoping next time would be different. That was vulnerability. That was risk."

"I know. I couldn't see it then, but I see it now."

"And you know what I learned? Vulnerability doesn't kill you. Getting hurt doesn't kill you. What kills you is living without the person you love because you're too scared to take the risk." He took a swig of his Coke. "I was miserable this week. Working on boats in Philadelphia, helping my uncle, trying to convince myself I should move on and find someone less complicated. Someone who wouldn't run away when things got real."

My chest ached. "Did you convince yourself?"

"No. Because I don't want someone less complicated. I want you. Complicated, scared, brilliant, stubborn, courageous you." His voice softened. "I've wanted you since the first summer, Josie. And watching you finally be honest at the marina—watching you cry and admit you were scared and tell me you loved me even though it terrified you—that was the bravest thing I've ever seen."

Tears pricked my eyes. "Matt—"

"Let me finish. Please." He turned to face me fully. "I'm not saying what you did was okay. Running away hurt. The cold distance hurt. Feeling like I was worth less than your fear—that hurt worst of all. And I'm not going to pretend it didn't happen or that I'm completely over it."

"I understand. I don't expect—"

"But," he continued, "I also understand why you did it. Your father drowned. You watched your mother fall apart. You swore you'd never need someone that way again. And then I came along and made you feel things that scared you worse than drowning. I get it, Josie. I get why you ran."

"That doesn't make it right."

"No, it doesn't. But it makes it understandable. And understanding is where forgiveness starts."

Hope fluttered in my chest, fragile and terrifying. "Are you saying—?"

"I'm saying I forgive you. For the three-year grudge. For running away. For the cold distance. For pushing me away when I tried to get close. I forgive you, Josie. Because holding onto hurt doesn't help either of us. And because I love you too much to let fear—yours or mine—destroy what we could have."

The tears spilled over. "I don't deserve you."

"Maybe not. But you've got me anyway, if you want me." He reached out and took my hand, the first real touch in weeks, and it felt like coming home. "But I need you to promise me something."

"Anything."

"Promise me that the next time you get scared—and you will get scared, because love is scary—you'll tell me. You'll talk to me instead of running away. You'll let me help you through it instead of shutting me out."

"I promise. I swear I promise, Matt. I'll talk to you. I'll be honest even when it's hard. I'll choose you over my fear every single time."

He studied my face, weighing my words. Then slowly, carefully, he smiled—that bright, genuine smile I'd been missing for weeks.

"Okay then."

"Okay?"

"Okay, we try this. For real this time. No more rivalry pretending to be something else. No more competition instead of connection. Just us, figuring out how to love each other despite being scared sometimes."

"I'd like that," I said, crying and smiling simultaneously. "I'd like that more than anything."

"Good. Because I've waited three years for this, Carter. I'm not letting you go easily now."

"I'm not going anywhere. I'm done running."

Matt pulled me closer, wrapping his arm around my shoulders. I leaned into him, feeling safe and scared and happy all at once. The sun was setting over the ocean, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and pinks. Waves rolled in with their eternal rhythm. The beach was emptying as families headed home.

"I got you something," Matt said after a moment. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small package wrapped in brown paper.

"You didn't have to—"

"I wanted to. Open it."

I unwrapped the package carefully. Inside was a smooth piece of sea glass, pale green and frosted from years in the ocean. Beautiful and perfect.

"I found it on the beach in Philadelphia," Matt explained. "It reminded me of you. Beautiful but sharp around the edges. Changed by rough water into something stronger."

I turned the sea glass over in my hands, tears still falling. "It's perfect."

"You're perfect. Even with all your sharp edges. Especially with all your sharp edges."

I looked up at him, at this boy who'd waited three years for me to stop being scared, who'd forgiven me for running away, who'd just compared me to sea glass and somehow made it the most romantic thing I'd ever heard.

"I love you," I said. "I know I said it at the marina, but I need you to hear it again. I love you, Matt Logan. I'm terrified and uncertain and I don't know how to do this without messing it up, but I love you. And I'm going to keep choosing you, even when it's scary."

"I love you too," he said simply. "Have for three years. Will for a long time to come."

Then he leaned down and kissed me—soft and sweet and full of forgiveness and hope and possibility. The kiss I'd run away from at the marina. The kiss I'd been too scared to accept.

Now I kissed him back, tasting salt water and Coca-Cola and three years of waiting. My hands came up to his face, his arms pulled me closer, and everything felt right in a way nothing had felt right since I'd pushed him away.

When we finally broke apart, both smiling, the sun had dipped below the horizon and the sky was fading from gold to purple.

"We should get back," Matt said, not moving. "People will wonder where we are."

"Let them wonder."

He laughed. "Fair enough. But eventually we do have to face the crew. Danny and Betty are going to be insufferable with their 'I told you so's."

"Worth it," I said, kissing him again.

And it was worth it. All of it—the fear, the vulnerability, the risk of getting hurt. Because sitting on the jetty with Matt's arms around me, finally brave enough to accept what I'd been running from, I understood something my mother had been trying to tell me for five years.

Being strong didn't mean being alone.

It meant being brave enough to let people in.

It meant diving into dangerous water even though you might get hurt.

It meant choosing love over fear, over and over, as many times as it took.

And I was finally ready to make that choice.
