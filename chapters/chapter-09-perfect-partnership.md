# Chapter 9: Perfect Partnership

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur.

Captain Ed ordered us off duty for the remainder of the shift—standard protocol after a critical rescue. "You've both done enough today," he said firmly. "Get some rest, file your reports, decompress."

Decompress. As if I could simply turn off the adrenaline still coursing through my veins, the memory of that child's limp body in my arms, the terror of thinking we might not reach him in time.

Matt and I walked to the lifeguard station together, neither of us speaking. The silence wasn't uncomfortable—it was the silence of shared experience, of two people who'd just been through something intense and didn't need words to understand what the other was feeling.

"Coffee?" Matt asked when we reached the station. "There's a pot in the break room."

I nodded. My hands were still shaking slightly, and something warm sounded good.

The break room was empty—everyone else was still on duty or handling the aftermath on the beach. Matt poured two cups of coffee, adding sugar to his without asking how I took mine. I usually drank it black, but I didn't correct him. The sweetness might help with the shakes.

We sat at the small table, coffee cups between us, and for the first time in three years, the silence between Matt Logan and me felt companionable rather than hostile.

"I keep replaying it," Matt said quietly. "Wondering what we could have done differently. If we could have reached him sooner."

"We did everything right," I said. "Captain Ed said so."

"I know. But that moment when he went under and you dove down—" Matt's hand tightened around his coffee cup. "I couldn't see you. The water was too murky. For those few seconds, I didn't know if you'd find him, if you'd come back up, if—" He stopped, shook his head. "It felt like forever."

I understood exactly what he meant. "When I grabbed him and he wasn't breathing, I thought we were too late. I thought—" My voice cracked slightly. "But then he coughed, and it was the best sound I'd ever heard."

"Because of you. You got him breathing."

"Because of us," I corrected again. "I couldn't have done it alone, Matt. The current was too strong. If you hadn't been there to help support him, to navigate us out of the riptide—" I met his eyes directly. "We were a team out there. A perfect team."

Something shifted in his expression—surprise, then something warmer. "We were, weren't we?"

"Yeah."

"Kind of strange, considering we've spent three years competing against each other."

"Maybe competition isn't the worst foundation for partnership," I said slowly, working through the thought as I spoke. "We know each other's strengths. We know how the other moves, thinks, reacts. We didn't have to discuss strategy out there—we just knew."

Matt nodded. "You said you'd get the kid, and I immediately understood I should block the current. No questions, no arguing about who was in charge. Just trust."

Trust. When had I started trusting Matt Logan?

The door opened and Danny stuck his head in. "Hey. Just wanted to check on you two. How're you doing?"

"We're okay," Matt said.

"That was some rescue. Whole crew's talking about it. Captain Ed called it the best coordinated emergency response he's seen in his career." Danny grinned. "You two are legends right now."

"We just did our job," I said.

"You saved a kid's life. That's more than just a job." Danny's expression turned serious. "But really, are you okay? Those kinds of rescues mess with your head."

"We're processing," Matt said. "Thanks for the backup out there. Having you take the kid for the final stretch made a big difference."

"That's what we're here for." Danny glanced between us, and I saw something knowing in his expression. "You two should stick around each other today. Talk it through. Don't go home and brood alone."

After he left, Matt looked at me. "He's got a point. Want to walk the beach? Might help to move around instead of sitting here replaying everything in our heads."

I should have said no. Should have maintained the distance I'd carefully constructed between us for three years. Should have gone home and processed this alone like I processed everything else.

But the thought of being alone with my thoughts right now felt wrong. And the idea of walking with Matt—who understood exactly what we'd been through because he'd been there beside me—felt right.

"Okay," I said.

We left our coffee cups in the break room and walked down to the water's edge. The beach was quieter now—late afternoon, families packing up, the dangerous riptide conditions keeping most swimmers out of the water. Captain Ed had reduced the swimming boundaries even further after the rescue.

We walked south along the waterline, neither of us speaking at first. The ocean rolled in steadily, deceptively peaceful again. Hard to believe it had nearly killed a child just hours ago.

"My father drowned," I said suddenly. The words came out before I'd consciously decided to say them. "That's why I became a lifeguard."

Matt stopped walking, turning to look at me with surprise and something like understanding in his eyes. "Josie—"

"I was twelve. We were on vacation at the shore—not here, different beach. He went swimming early one morning, and the current got him. By the time someone noticed he was in trouble, it was too late." I stared at the ocean, seeing that morning five years ago. "No lifeguards on duty. No one to help. He just... didn't come back."

"I'm so sorry."

"I learned to swim after that. Got obsessed with it—with being strong enough, fast enough, good enough that I could save someone if they needed it. So that no one else would have to watch someone they love disappear into the water and not come back."

Matt was quiet for a moment, processing. "That's why you're so driven. Why you train so hard."

"Partly." I looked at him. "And partly because I needed to prove something after your joke three years ago. Needed to prove I was good enough, that being a girl didn't make me less capable."

"That stupid joke." Matt ran a hand through his salt-stiff hair. "I've regretted it for three years, Josie. If I could take it back—"

"I know." And I did know. I'd seen the regret in his eyes every time he tried to apologize, every time I shut him down. "I think I've known for a while that you didn't mean it the way I took it. But it was easier to stay angry than to—" I paused, trying to find the right words. "Than to admit that you scared me."

"I scared you?"

"Not you exactly. What you represented. Someone who could challenge me, push me, see through my defenses. Someone who might—" I stopped, not quite ready to finish that thought. "It was safer to keep you as an enemy than to let you be anything else."

Matt stepped closer, his expression intent. "And now?"

"Now I don't know." I met his eyes. "Today changed something. Out there in the water, we weren't rivals. We were partners. And it felt—" I searched for the word. "Right. It felt right."

"It did," Matt agreed quietly. "We work well together, Josie. We always have, even when we were competing. Maybe especially when we were competing."

"So what does that mean?"

"I don't know. But maybe we could find out." He held out his hand, not demanding, just offering. "Start over? Not enemies, not rivals. Just two lifeguards who make a pretty good team?"

I looked at his outstretched hand, thinking about three years of rivalry, three years of walls and defenses and refusing to let him close. Thinking about today, about how perfectly we'd worked together when it mattered most.

I took his hand. "Okay. Starting over."

His smile was genuine and warm, transforming his face. "Hi. I'm Matt Logan. I'm an idiot who made a terrible first impression three years ago, but I'd really like a chance to make a better second impression."

Despite everything—the exhaustion, the lingering fear, the emotional weight of the day—I laughed. "I'm Josie Carter. I'm stubborn and competitive and I hold grudges too long, but I'm trying to work on that."

"Sounds like we're both works in progress."

"Maybe that's okay."

We stood there on the beach, hands clasped, and something felt different. Lighter. Like I'd been carrying a heavy weight for three years and had finally set it down.

"So," Matt said, still holding my hand, "does this mean we're friends now?"

"I think it might."

"Good. Because I've wanted to be your friend since that first summer. I just had no idea how to get past your defenses."

"Try being less annoyingly perfect at everything."

He laughed. "I'm not perfect. I just work really hard."

"Same."

"I know. That's one of the things I—" He stopped, seemed to reconsider his words. "One of the things I respect most about you. Your dedication. Your refusal to quit, even when things get hard."

The sincerity in his voice made my chest feel tight. "I respect you too. Even when I was pretending I didn't."

We started walking again, still holding hands, and I didn't pull away. It felt natural, comfortable in a way I hadn't expected. Like maybe this—whatever this was becoming—had been waiting for us all along, and we'd finally stopped fighting long enough to notice.

Betty found us an hour later, walking near the jetty as the sun started its descent toward the horizon. She took one look at our joined hands and her entire face lit up.

"Oh my God. Oh my God, it finally happened!" She practically bounced with excitement. "I heard about the rescue—everyone's talking about it—but this—" She gestured at our hands. "This is amazing!"

"We're just friends, Betty," I said, but my face was heating.

"Friends who are holding hands and look at each other like that?" Betty grinned. "Sure. Friends. I'll go with that for now."

After she left—still grinning like she'd won a bet—Matt looked at me with amusement. "She's subtle."

"She's been waiting for this for three years. I'll never hear the end of it."

"Worth it?"

I considered the question. Was it worth Betty's inevitable teasing, the crew's knowing looks, the shift in dynamics that would come from Matt and I being friends instead of rivals?

I looked at him—really looked at him—and saw someone who'd stayed beside me in dangerous water, who'd trusted me to do my job while he did his, who'd called me courageous and meant it. Someone who'd been trying to apologize for three years while I stubbornly refused to listen.

"Yeah," I said. "It's worth it."

His smile was bright enough to rival the setting sun.

We walked back to the lifeguard station as the beach emptied and evening settled over Marina Bay. Tomorrow we'd go back to training for the competition, back to our duties, back to normal life. But something fundamental had shifted today.

Matt Logan wasn't my enemy anymore. He wasn't even just my rival.

He was my partner. My friend.

And maybe, someday, something more.
