# Chapter 12: The Truth About the Joke

Thursday evening, Matt and I volunteered to be the closing guards. The beach was nearly empty by seven p.m., sunset painting everything gold and orange.

"Beautiful night," Matt said as we walked together.

"Yeah."

We'd fallen into an easy rhythm over the past few days, but there was still one conversation we hadn't had. One piece of history unresolved.

As if reading my thoughts, Matt stopped walking and turned to face me. "Can we talk about something?"

My stomach tightened. "Okay."

"The first day. Three years ago. The joke." He ran a hand through his hair. "I've apologized, but I've never really explained what actually happened."

"I'm listening."

"I was sixteen, showing up completely intimidated. Everyone else seemed to belong there. And then Captain Ed introduced you—fifteen years old, scared but trying not to show it. Chin up, shoulders back, daring anyone to question whether you belonged." He smiled slightly. "And I thought you were the bravest person I'd ever seen."

I hadn't expected that. "Brave?"

"Terrified but doing it anyway. That's courage." Matt faced me fully. "When Rick made that comment, everyone was looking at me, waiting to see how I'd react. And I panicked."

"So you laughed."

"So I laughed," he confirmed, shame clear in his voice. "Not because I agreed with him. Not because I thought you couldn't keep up. But because I was sixteen and desperate to fit in, and laughing along seemed like the easiest way to be accepted by the older guys. It was cowardice, pure and simple."

The explanation wasn't an excuse, but it was honest. And I could see how it had happened—a scared kid trying to find his place, making a split-second decision that would echo for three years.

"The moment the words were out of my mouth, I regretted them," Matt continued. "I saw your expression—the way you shut down, went cold. And I knew I'd screwed up badly. But I didn't know how to fix it. You wouldn't look at me for the rest of the day."

"I was humiliated."

"I know. And you had every right to be." Matt's voice was earnest. "When I tried to apologize in the equipment shed, you shut me down. That's when I realized apologies weren't going to work. You'd already decided who I was."

"So you gave up?"

"So I competed instead. If I couldn't make you forgive me, maybe I could earn your respect. Every race, every drill—I was trying to prove I wasn't the careless idiot who laughed at that joke."

The revelation shifted my understanding of the past three years. All that competition, all those challenges—he'd been trying to prove himself to me the whole time.

"I thought you were trying to beat me," I said quietly. "To prove you were better."

"I was trying to prove I was worthy of your respect." Matt stepped closer. "You've been the standard I measured myself against for three years. Every improvement—it was because I was trying to be someone you might eventually forgive."

My chest felt tight. "Matt—"

"The joke was never about you being a girl or less capable. It was about me being a scared kid who made a terrible choice."

"Why tell me this now?"

"Because we're friends now. And I don't want our friendship built on a misunderstanding." His expression was vulnerable. "I want you to know the truth—all of it."

I thought about fifteen-year-old Josie, hurt and defensive, building walls that would last three years. I thought about sixteen-year-old Matt, desperate to belong, making one stupid choice that would define how we saw each other. And I thought about who we were now—people who'd saved a life together, who'd learned to trust each other, who were building something real on the ruins of all that misunderstanding.

"I believe you," I said.

Matt looked surprised. "You do?"

"Yeah. Because I've spent the last few days getting to know you—the real you—and that person wouldn't make a joke like that. Not now. But a scared sixteen-year-old trying to fit in? That person might. That person did."

"I'm sorry, Josie. I was wrong, and I hurt you, and I'm sorrier than I can adequately express."

"I know." And I did know. I could see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice, feel it in the way he'd spent three years trying to earn back what he'd lost in one moment. "I forgive you."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." I smiled slightly. "Though I reserve the right to bring it up occasionally when I need to win an argument."

Matt laughed, relief and joy mixing in the sound. "Fair enough. I deserve that."

We sat on the sand, watching the sunset.

"Can I ask you something?" Matt said.

"Sure."

"Why did you hold onto the anger so long? You're not usually the type to hold grudges."

"Because it wasn't really about the joke. Not entirely."

"What was it about?"

"Losing my father. Being scared and angry. Needing someone to push against." I looked at him. "You were convenient. I held onto that anger because it was easier than dealing with my grief."

"The grief."

"The grief, the fear, the belief that vulnerability meant weakness." I drew patterns in the sand. "You became my rival because rivalry felt safer than everything else."

"And now?"

"Now I'm realizing that safety isn't always happiness. And that vulnerability isn't weakness."

"Thank you for being honest."

"No more walls," I said.

"No more walls," he agreed.

"Josie," Matt said softly. "During the rescue—when you dove down and I couldn't see you—I was terrified. Not just for the kid, but for you. I realized you'd become the most important person in my life."

My heart pounded. "Matt—"

"I'm not pressuring you or rushing anything. I just—after everything we've talked about tonight, all the honesty—I needed you to know that too. That this—" he gestured between us "—means something to me. You mean something to me. More than just friends, if I'm being completely honest."

The admission hung in the air between us, weighted with possibility and risk. This was the moment where I could deflect, could make a joke, could retreat back into the safety I'd maintained for three years.

Or I could be brave. I could match his honesty with my own.

"You mean something to me too," I said quietly. "More than just friends. But also—I'm scared, Matt. Of feeling too much, of needing someone, of—"

"Of being vulnerable."

"Yeah."

"That's okay. We can go slow. We can be friends who both acknowledge there might be something more, and we can figure it out as we go. No pressure, no rush." He held my gaze steadily. "I've waited three years to have you in my life in any meaningful way. I can wait a little longer for you to be ready for whatever comes next."

The gentleness of the offer, the patience, the understanding—it undid something in me. Some last defense crumbling, some wall I'd maintained for so long finally giving way.

"What if I'm never ready?" I asked, voicing my deepest fear. "What if I'm too broken from losing my father to ever really trust someone that way?"

"Then we'll be the best friends who ever existed, and I'll count myself lucky to have that much of you." Matt smiled, genuine and warm. "But Josie? I don't think you're broken. I think you're strong and brave and you're learning how to let people in. And I think you're doing a remarkable job of it."

Tears pricked my eyes unexpectedly. "You have a lot of faith in me."

"Because you've earned it. Because I see who you are—not who you're afraid you might be."

We sat there as the sun disappeared below the horizon, as the sky shifted from gold to purple to deep blue. The stars began to emerge, one by one, mapping constellations across the darkening sky. And for the first time since my father died, I felt like maybe—just maybe—I could trust someone with my heart and survive if things went wrong.

Because Matt wasn't asking me to stop being strong. He was asking me to be brave enough to be vulnerable.

And maybe that was the same thing.

Maybe the bravest thing I could do wasn't holding everyone at arm's length. Maybe it was letting someone in.

"Okay," I said finally.

"Okay what?"

"Okay, let's figure it out as we go. Friends who acknowledge there might be something more."

Matt's smile was bright enough to rival the vanished sun. "Yeah?"

"Yeah."

He reached for my hand, and I let him take it. Our fingers intertwined, and the touch felt both familiar and brand new—a promise and a possibility.

We sat until full dark, hands clasped, watching stars emerge. When we finally walked back to the station, everything felt different.

Lighter. Clearer. True.

The past three years of rivalry had led us here—to this moment of honesty and hope.

And I wouldn't trade any of it. Every competition, every challenge—it had all been necessary to get to this point.

Where we could finally stop running and face each other instead.
