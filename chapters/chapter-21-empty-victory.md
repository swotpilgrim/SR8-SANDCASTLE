# Chapter 21: Empty Victory

The beach bonfire celebration that evening should have been perfect.

Captain Ed had arranged everything—driftwood stacked high on the sand, flames crackling orange and gold against the darkening sky, crew members and competitors gathered in a circle sharing stories and laughter. Families had gone home. The beach belonged to us lifeguards now, celebrating the end of another successful season and another exciting competition.

I stood at the edge of the firelight, trophy in hand, feeling like a ghost at my own victory party.

"To our co-champions!" Danny raised a bottle of Coca-Cola in salute. "Carter and Logan, best damn guards on the beach!"

The crew cheered. I forced a smile and raised my own bottle in acknowledgment. Across the fire, Matt did the same, his expression polite but distant.

We were co-winners. Perfect tie. Should have brought us together.

Instead, the trophy in my hands felt like a gravestone marking what I'd killed.

Linda appeared beside me, her bronze trophy tucked under one arm. "Congratulations, Josie. You deserve it. You trained harder than anyone."

"Thanks. You did great too. Third place is impressive."

"I'm satisfied with it." Linda glanced across the fire to where Matt stood with Danny and some guards from Long Branch. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"What happened between you and Matt? Everyone thought—" She stopped, reconsidered her words. "We all saw how you were together after the rescue. And then suddenly you weren't. And now you've won together but you're standing on opposite sides of the fire like strangers."

I didn't have a good answer. "I got scared. Pushed him away. And now it's too late."

Linda studied me for a long moment. "Is it? Too late, I mean?"

"He's leaving tomorrow. And even if he wasn't, I hurt him too badly. Some things you can't fix."

"Maybe." Linda took a sip of her Coke. "But he looks just as miserable as you do. That's got to count for something."

After she walked away, I watched Matt across the fire. He was talking with the other competitors, smiling at their jokes, looking every inch the confident, capable lifeguard who'd just co-won the biggest competition of the summer.

But I could see the tightness around his eyes, the way his smile didn't quite reach them, the careful way he avoided looking in my direction.

He was miserable too.

And I'd done that to him.

Betty appeared at my elbow, her approach silent. "So. Co-champion. How does it feel?"

"Empty."

"Good."

I looked at her in surprise. "Good?"

"You needed to learn this lesson, Josie. That winning doesn't mean anything if you lose yourself—or lose someone important—in the process." She gestured at the trophy. "That's just metal and engraving. It doesn't keep you warm at night. It doesn't make you laugh. It doesn't challenge you to be better. Matt did all those things. And you threw him away for that."

The words stung because they were absolutely true.

"I know," I said quietly. "I know I was an idiot. I know I chose wrong. But what am I supposed to do now? Walk over there and apologize? Tell him I made a mistake? He won't want to hear it, Betty. He's done with me."

"Are you sure? Or are you just scared to find out?"

Before I could answer, Captain Ed called for attention. The crew quieted, all eyes turning to our captain standing by the fire.

"I want to say a few words about this summer," he said, his voice carrying authority and affection. "We've had an excellent season. Thousands of swimmers kept safe. Several critical rescues performed flawlessly. A crew that worked together like family." He paused, looking around the circle. "And a competition that reminded us why we do this work."

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the group.

"Matt Logan and Josie Carter demonstrated everything a lifeguard should be—skill, endurance, judgment, and most importantly, partnership. When it mattered most, during that team event, they showed us what perfect coordination looks like. They moved as one unit, trusted completely, and executed a rescue that will be talked about for years."

I felt heat rising in my face. Across the fire, Matt was looking down at his trophy.

"That's the kind of excellence I want to see from all of you. Not just technical skill, but the ability to work with your partner, trust them, support them, and achieve together what you couldn't alone." Captain Ed raised his bottle. "To partnership. The foundation of everything we do."

"To partnership!" the crew echoed.

I drank the toast mechanically, the words echoing in my head. Partnership. The thing Matt had tried to offer me. The thing I'd rejected because I was too scared to accept it.

The bonfire celebration continued around me—guards swapping stories about difficult rescues, families that returned year after year, the antics of weekend crowds. Someone produced a transistor radio and music drifted across the beach. A few couples started dancing in the sand.

Matt stood alone now, Danny having wandered off to talk to Linda. He stared into the fire, lost in thought, his trophy at his feet.

I should have walked over. Should have tried to talk to him. Should have done something other than standing here holding my hollow victory.

But my feet wouldn't move.

"I heard Matt's leaving early," said one of the guards from Surf City, his voice carrying across the fire. "Boat delivery to Philadelphia or something?"

"Yeah," Danny confirmed. "His uncle needs help taking a cabin cruiser up the coast. Matt's leaving tomorrow morning. Ending his season a week early."

Tomorrow morning. The words hit me like cold water.

I'd known, of course. Betty had told me. Danny had mentioned it. But hearing it discussed so casually—Matt leaving, Matt gone, Matt moving on with his life without me—made it real in a way it hadn't been before.

Tomorrow morning he'd be gone.

And I'd be here alone with my trophy and my regrets.

The fire burned lower as the evening wore on. Guards began saying their goodbyes—competing crews heading back to their stations, local crew members drifting toward home. The celebration was ending.

Matt stood, picked up his trophy, said something to Danny I couldn't hear. They shook hands, the handshake turning into a brief hug. Brothers, I thought. Danny and Matt had become brothers this summer. Real friendship forged through work and trust.

The kind of relationship I could have had with Matt, if I'd been brave enough.

Matt started walking away from the fire, toward the lifeguard quarters where visiting guards stayed during competition. Away from the celebration. Away from the crew. Away from me.

Betty grabbed my arm. "If you're going to do something, do it now. He's leaving in the morning, Josie. This is your last chance."

"I don't know what to say."

"Start with the truth. Tell him you were wrong. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him—" She stopped, squeezed my arm harder. "Tell him you love him."

"He won't believe me. Not after everything."

"Maybe not. But at least you'll have tried. At least you won't spend the rest of your life wondering what might have happened if you'd been brave enough to be honest."

She was right. I knew she was right.

But watching Matt walk away into the darkness, I felt paralyzed by fear—the same fear that had made me push him away in the first place. The fear of vulnerability, of rejection, of needing someone and losing them.

"Go," Betty said, pushing me gently. "Before it's too late."

I looked at the trophy in my hands—cool metal, engraved words, physical proof I was good enough, strong enough, capable enough to win.

And I understood with perfect clarity that it meant absolutely nothing.

Matt disappeared into the darkness beyond the bonfire's reach.

Tomorrow morning he'd be gone.

And I'd be here alone, still holding this trophy, still protecting my heart, still safe and strong and completely, devastatingly empty.

The bonfire crackled and sparked. The remaining crew members talked quietly. The ocean rolled in with its eternal rhythm, indifferent to human heartbreak.

I stood at the edge of the firelight, trophy in hand, and made my decision.

Tomorrow. First thing tomorrow morning, before he left, I'd find him. I'd apologize. I'd tell him the truth about how I felt. I'd be vulnerable and honest even though it terrified me.

And if he told me it was too late, that I'd hurt him too much, that he was done waiting?

At least I would have tried.

At least I'd have been brave enough, finally, to risk my heart.

The bonfire burned down to embers as the last crew members drifted away, calling goodbyes and congratulations. Betty hugged me tight before leaving.

"Don't wait too long tomorrow," she whispered. "Early morning means early. Don't let him leave without telling him."

"I won't," I promised.

I walked back to my boarding house alone, trophy tucked under my arm, sand crunching beneath my feet. The night was beautiful—stars scattered across the dark sky, warm breeze carrying salt air, Marina Bay peaceful and perfect.

All the beauty in the world, and all I could feel was the hollow ache where my heart should be.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'd fix this, or at least try.

Tomorrow I'd be brave.

Tonight, I was just a girl with a trophy and a broken heart, walking home alone from her victory celebration, finally understanding that winning meant nothing if you'd lost what actually mattered.
