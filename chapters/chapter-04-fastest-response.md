# Chapter 4: Fastest Response

Wednesday morning arrived with perfect beach weather. Captain Ed gathered the crew before shift start, clipboard in hand and that gleam in his eye that meant he was about to make us work.

"Response time drills today," he announced. "I want every guard sharp and fast. When that whistle blows, I need to know you can reach your victim before the situation goes critical."

The new guards looked nervous. The returning guards looked competitive.

I felt Matt's presence beside me without looking—we'd both gravitated toward the front of the group, neither willing to hang back and appear less eager.

"Here's how this works," Captain Ed continued. "I'll use the whistle system to simulate emergencies at marked positions in the water. You'll respond from your assigned stands. I'm timing everyone, and the results go on the permanent record."

Danny grinned. "Betting pool, anyone?"

"Sullivan, I'm pretending I didn't hear that," Captain Ed said, but there was amusement in his voice. He knew perfectly well the crew bet on everything. "Carter, Logan—you two are up first. Let the new guards see how it's done."

Of course he'd pair us first. Captain Ed loved his little teaching moments, and Matt and I were his prize examples of competitive excellence.

We walked to our respective stands without speaking. I climbed the ladder to stand three, and Matt took stand four. Fifteen feet of sand between us, but I could feel the competitive energy crackling like heat lightning.

"Mark positions alpha and beta!" Captain Ed called. Two guards jogged out and placed bright orange buoys in the water at predetermined distances—about a hundred yards offshore, one in my zone, one in Matt's.

Captain Ed raised his whistle. "On my signal! Three... two... one!"

The whistle shrieked.

I vaulted over the platform and hit the sand running, rescue buoy in hand. My legs pumped hard, feet finding purchase with practiced efficiency. Matt landed beside me—not ahead, not behind, perfectly even.

We hit the water at the same moment.

I dove forward, arms cutting through waves, legs kicking in powerful rhythm. Matt matched me stroke for stroke. We surged through the water in parallel, driving hard toward our markers.

I reached my buoy in what felt like seconds. Tagged it, spun, and powered back toward shore. The return was harder—swimming against the waves—but I pushed through, refusing to slow.

I staggered up the beach and collapsed in the sand, gasping for air. Two seconds later, Matt dropped beside me, equally winded.

Captain Ed stood over us with his stopwatch, eyebrows raised. "Well. Carter, one minute forty-three seconds. Logan, one minute forty-four."

One second. One second difference between us.

Matt looked at me, breathing hard, and something flickered in his expression—respect mixed with frustration mixed with something else I couldn't name.

"Not bad, Carter," he managed between breaths.

"You too, Logan."

The rest of the crew took their turns. Some were good, some were decent, some needed more training. None were as fast as Matt and me.

When everyone had run once, Captain Ed announced we'd do it again—different positions, longer distances, rougher conditions.

"Same pairs as before. Let's see if you can beat your own times."

This time the markers were further out, starting positions behind our stands.

The whistle blew.

I scrambled up my ladder, over the platform, down the other side, and hit the beach running. Matt and I entered the water simultaneously, timing synchronized perfectly. We swam hard through choppier surf, fighting wave patterns. My shoulders screamed. My lungs burned.

But I didn't slow. Neither did he.

We reached our markers within a heartbeat of each other. I heard his splash as he tagged his buoy just as I touched mine. The return swim was brutal—distance and fatigue combining to make every stroke harder than the last.

I thought about quitting. My body begged me to slow, to ease up, to save something for later.

Then I heard Matt's breathing beside me, heard his arms cutting water, and pride surged through exhaustion. I would not be the first to slow. I would not lose to him.

I found reserves I didn't know I had and pushed harder.

We hit the shallows together, stumbled onto sand together, collapsed together in a tangle of limbs and gasping breaths. For a moment we just lay there, chests heaving, too spent to move.

"Sweet mercy," Matt breathed. "That was brutal."

"Agreed."

Captain Ed's boots appeared in my field of vision. "Carter, two minutes twelve. Logan, two minutes eleven."

This time Matt had won. By one second.

I rolled onto my back, staring at the sky, and started laughing. I couldn't help it—the absurdity of it, the perfect matched competition, the fact that we'd both nearly killed ourselves for a one-second difference.

Matt looked over at me, surprised, and then he was laughing too.

"You two are insane," Danny called from where he was stretching for his turn. "You know that, right?"

"Probably," I admitted, still catching my breath.

"Definitely," Matt agreed.

The drills continued. We ran five more trials, trading victories by fractions of seconds. Trial three: I won by point-eight seconds. Trial four: Matt won. Trial five: exact tie.

By the final trial, the entire crew had stopped to watch us, placing bets, shouting encouragement.

"Last run," Captain Ed announced. "Maximum distance markers. This is endurance, people. Pace yourselves."

The markers went out to what looked like quarter-mile distance. Swimming that far and back at competition speed would drain every reserve.

Matt and I stood at our starting positions, both soaked and exhausted already, both refusing to back down.

"You got anything left in the tank, Carter?" Matt called over.

"More than you, Logan."

"Prove it."

The whistle blew.

I ran. I swam. I pushed past every reasonable limit, muscles trembling, lungs burning, vision narrowing to just the marker ahead. Matt beside me, both of us too stubborn to quit.

The swim felt endless. My technique broke down, strokes sloppy, kicks weak. Matt was struggling too.

I tagged the marker and turned for shore. My arms felt like lead. Everything hurt.

But I kept swimming because Matt was still swimming.

Each stroke was a victory. Each breath a choice to continue.

Twenty yards from shore, my leg cramped viciously. I gasped, faltered, lost my rhythm. Matt pulled ahead by a body length.

No.

I gritted my teeth and kicked through the pain, ignoring my body's desperate signals to stop. Matt was slowing too—I saw his stroke rate dropping, his form degrading.

Ten yards. Five yards. Shallow water.

We staggered onto the beach on pure willpower, both stumbling, both barely able to stand. Matt's legs gave out first and he dropped to his knees. I made it three more steps before collapsing beside him.

For a long moment, neither of us could speak. We just knelt there in the wet sand, gasping for air, shaking with exhaustion.

Captain Ed approached, looking concerned. "You two all right?"

"Fine," I wheezed.

"Dandy," Matt managed.

"Carter, three minutes forty-one seconds. Logan, three minutes forty seconds."

He'd won. By one second. Again.

I should have been frustrated. Angry. Determined to demand a rematch.

Instead, I looked at Matt—really looked at him. His face was flushed with exertion, hair plastered to his head, chest heaving. He looked exactly how I felt: completely spent and somehow exhilarated.

Our eyes met, and something passed between us. Recognition. Respect. Understanding that we'd both just pushed ourselves to absolute limits and matched each other stride for stride.

"You're fast, Logan," I said quietly.

He looked surprised, then smiled—not the cocky grin, but something genuine. "So are you, Carter. That leg cramp almost killed you and you still nearly caught me."

"Nearly doesn't count."

"No, but it was close. Closest I've ever been pushed."

"Same."

Captain Ed cleared his throat. "All right, you two. Get some water and rest. I've seen what I needed to see."

As the crew dispersed, Danny wandered over and looked down at us, still collapsed in the sand. "You know, most people compete to win. You two compete like you're trying to prove something."

"We are proving something," I said.

"What? That you're equally stubborn?"

Matt laughed, a tired but real sound. "Maybe that's exactly what we're proving."

I found myself smiling despite my exhaustion.

Later that afternoon, after I'd recovered enough to climb back on my stand, Betty appeared with ice cream cones.

"Heard you and Matt almost killed yourselves this morning," she said, handing me a strawberry cone.

"News travels fast."

"Danny might have stopped by to describe the epic battle in detail." Betty settled in the sand at the base of my stand. "He said you two were incredible."

"We tied, mostly. He won by one second overall."

"And how do you feel about that?"

I considered the question honestly. How did I feel? Not as angry as I should be. Not as frustrated. Instead, I felt... energized. Alive. Like something had shifted in the drills this morning, some dynamic between Matt and me that was more than pure antagonism.

"I don't know," I admitted. "It was actually kind of... fun."

Betty's eyes widened. "Fun? You had fun competing with Matt Logan?"

"Don't make a big deal out of it."

"Josie. You just admitted you enjoyed something with your supposed rival. That is a big deal."

"We're both lifeguards. We both like swimming fast. That's all it was."

"Mm-hmm." Betty's smile was knowing. "And the fact that Danny said Matt was watching you with what he described as 'definite interest' has nothing to do with anything?"

My face heated. "Danny needs to mind his own business."

"Danny is a very observant person. And he thinks Matt likes you."

"Matt and I compete. That's different from liking."

"Is it?" Betty stood, brushing sand from her skirt. "Because from where I'm standing, you two just spent an entire morning pushing each other to be better. That sounds less like rivalry and more like... something else."

She left me with that thought and a melting ice cream cone.

I looked across at stand four, where Matt was back on duty, scanning the water with his usual vigilance. As if sensing my gaze, he glanced over. Our eyes met across the distance.

He raised his hand in a small wave. After a moment's hesitation, I waved back.

It was a tiny gesture, nothing significant. But it felt like something had changed between us. Like maybe we were both starting to wonder if there might be more to our dynamic than just competition.

I turned back to my water, but I couldn't stop the small smile that tugged at my lips.

This summer was definitely going to be interesting.
