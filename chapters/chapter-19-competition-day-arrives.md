# Chapter 19: Competition Day Arrives

The last weekend of August arrived with perfect weather—clear skies, moderate surf, and a light breeze that kept the heat manageable. Competition weather. The kind of day I'd been training for all summer.

I should have been excited. Should have felt the anticipatory thrill I'd been imagining since June. Instead, I felt hollow.

The beach was transformed. Spectators filled the sand—locals, families, competing lifeguard crews from beaches up and down the coast. Captain Ed had arranged chairs and roped-off areas. A scoreboard stood near the station, ready to track performances. Banners announced the Marina Bay Beach Lifeguard Competition in bold letters.

The festive atmosphere reminded me of a carnival—concession stands, children running around with flags, crew families setting up picnic blankets. Betty's family had closed the ice cream shop for the day so they could watch. Tommy Chen was there with a group of teenagers, all wearing "Go Marina Bay!" shirts.

It should have been perfect.

Matt arrived with his family—his mother and three younger brothers all talking excitedly. I watched from a distance as they hugged him, clearly proud. Tommy immediately ran off toward the water. Kevin asked what looked like a thousand technical questions. Jamie climbed on Matt's back demanding attention.

He looked happy in that moment. Genuinely happy in a way I hadn't seen all week.

Then he spotted me across the crowd, and the happiness dimmed. He said something to his mother, who looked my direction with an expression I couldn't quite read, then turned back to his family.

Right. I'd forfeited my right to be part of that circle.

Captain Ed gathered all competitors near the station for the opening ceremony. Fourteen guards total—the Marina Bay crew plus visitors from Surf City, Long Branch, and Asbury Park. Everyone knew the real competition was between Matt and me, though. The betting board Danny had set up showed us as heavy favorites.

"Welcome to the eighth annual Marina Bay Beach Lifeguard Competition," Captain Ed announced, his voice carrying across the crowd. "Today and tomorrow, these lifeguards will demonstrate the skills that keep our beaches safe—swimming, rescue techniques, endurance, first aid knowledge, and teamwork. Let's give them a round of applause."

The crowd cheered. I forced a smile and waved.

Captain Ed continued, "Today's events are individual competitions—swimming races at various distances, rescue simulations with actors playing victims, and first aid scenarios. Tomorrow we'll have endurance challenges and team events. Scores will be tallied continuously, with final rankings announced tomorrow evening. Competitors, good luck. May the best lifeguard win."

We lined up for the traditional handshake ceremony—competitors greeting each other with sportsmanship before battle. When Matt and I reached each other in line, we shook hands briefly, our eyes not quite meeting.

"Good luck," he said formally.

"You too."

His hand was warm and calloused and familiar. I wanted to hold on, to pull him close, to whisper that I was sorry and could we please stop this cold distance and go back to being what we'd almost become.

Instead, I released his hand and moved to the next competitor.

The first event was the hundred-meter sprint. Six competitors at a time, racing from shore to buoy and back. Matt went in the second heat. I watched him dive in and knife through the water with powerful efficiency, his form perfect. He won his heat easily.

My heat was fourth. I stood at the water's edge, trying to find the focus that usually came so easily. But all I could think about was Matt watching from the sidelines, probably not caring whether I won or lost, probably just counting minutes until this competition was over and he could leave Marina Bay forever.

Captain Ed's whistle blew.

I dove.

The water closed around me and muscle memory took over. Stroke, stroke, breathe. Kick, kick, rotate. My arms pulled, my legs drove, my lungs burned. The buoy appeared ahead, I tagged it, turned, and pushed back toward shore.

When I touched sand and stood, gasping, Captain Ed was checking his stopwatch.

"First place in your heat, Carter. Third fastest overall time."

Third? I'd been training obsessively. Third wasn't good enough.

"Logan's time?" I asked.

"First overall by two seconds."

Of course.

The next event was distance swimming—five hundred meters out and back. Endurance rather than speed. This was my strength—I'd always been better at long distances than sprints.

Matt went in an earlier heat again. I watched him pace himself perfectly, settling into a rhythm that could last forever. He didn't rush, didn't tire, just swam with machine-like consistency. When he finished, he wasn't even breathing hard.

My heat came last. I dove in determined to beat his time, pushed hard through the first half, then felt my arms beginning to tire. I'd been so focused on training for speed that I'd forgotten to maintain my endurance base.

Amateur mistake.

I finished second in my heat, fourth overall. Behind Matt by fifteen seconds.

The scoreboard after morning events showed Matt leading with ninety-two points, me in second with eighty-eight, and Linda third with seventy-six.

Lunch break brought no relief. I ate a sandwich mechanically while Betty tried to be encouraging.

"You're doing great," she said. "Only four points behind."

"I'm doing terribly. Third in sprints, fourth in distance. These are events I should dominate."

"You're distracted."

"I know I'm distracted." The words came out sharper than intended. "Sorry. I just—I can't focus. All I can think about is Matt, and how I ruined everything, and how even if I win this stupid trophy, it won't mean anything because I lost what actually mattered."

Betty squeezed my hand. "So tell him that."

"After the competition. I promised myself I'd wait until after."

"Why wait?"

"Because he's competing too, and he deserves to focus on that without me adding drama."

"I think you're making excuses. But okay. After the competition." She paused. "Just don't wait too long, Josie. Danny told me Matt's planning to leave Tuesday morning for Philadelphia. That's only three days away."

Three days. The knowledge sat in my stomach like lead.

Afternoon events were rescue simulations. Actors played victims in various scenarios—panicking swimmer, unconscious person, child in distress. We were scored on response time, technique, victim management, and safety protocols.

This was where Matt and I had always excelled. This was what we'd been trained for.

Matt went first on the panicking swimmer scenario. He approached carefully, talked the "victim" down, secured them properly, and brought them back with textbook efficiency. The crowd applauded. His family cheered loudly.

My scenario was the unconscious victim. I had to dive under, retrieve them from six feet down, get them breathing, and bring them back. I'd practiced this a hundred times.

I dove, found the actor, pulled them up, started rescue breathing while supporting them in the water, then swam them back while maintaining their airway. Technically perfect.

But as I delivered the "victim" to shore, all I could think about was the real rescue—the little boy in the riptide, Matt appearing beside me exactly when I needed him, us working in perfect partnership. That had meant something. That had been real.

This felt like pantomime.

The first aid event was last—scenario-based challenges where we had to diagnose and treat simulated injuries. I scored well. So did Matt. We were still separated by only a few points going into the final event of the day: judgment and risk assessment.

For this event, Captain Ed described a dangerous situation and we had to explain our response. It tested knowledge, experience, and decision-making under pressure.

"You're the only guard on duty," Captain Ed said to me. "You spot two swimmers in distress—one adult male caught in riptide in the north section, one elderly woman struggling near the pier in the south section. Both are beyond safe swimming zones. Both are in immediate danger. What do you do?"

It was an impossible scenario. No good answer. Whatever choice you made, someone would potentially be harmed.

"I'd blow emergency whistle to signal for backup," I said. "Then assess which victim is in more immediate danger based on position, condition, and environmental factors. Choose the one most likely to go under first, effect rescue, return them to shore, and immediately respond to second victim while backup arrives."

"But backup might not arrive in time for the second victim."

"Then I make the best choice I can with the information I have and live with the consequences."

Captain Ed nodded. "Sometimes there are no good options. Only the option you can live with. Logan, same scenario. Your response?"

Matt's answer was nearly identical to mine, but he added something that hit me like a punch to the gut.

"In that situation, if I had a trained partner on adjacent stand, we'd coordinate response—I'd take one victim, they'd take the other, and we'd both succeed. Partnership eliminates impossible choices."

The words weren't directed at me specifically. He was answering the question. But I heard the subtext: *We were a good team. We could have been great together. And you threw that away.*

When scoring for Day One was tallied and posted, the results showed:

1. Matt Logan - 185 points
2. Josie Carter - 181 points
3. Linda Hayes - 152 points

Four points. Four measly points between us.

The crowd applauded. Matt's family mobbed him. Betty hugged me enthusiastically. Everyone congratulated us on being so evenly matched, so clearly the best guards on the beach, so exciting to watch.

But standing there holding my score sheet, watching Matt celebrate with his family while I stood alone, I felt nothing but emptiness.

I'd dreamed of this competition for months. Trained obsessively. Made it the focus of my entire summer. And now that it was actually happening, now that I was actually performing well and had a real shot at winning?

It meant absolutely nothing.

Because Matt was right. Victory without partnership was just hollow achievement. And I'd thrown away the partnership that actually mattered.

The sun set on Day One of competition with me standing alone on the beach, trophy within reach, and happiness impossibly far away.

Tomorrow would bring the team events and final scoring.

Tomorrow I'd compete with everything I had.

And tomorrow night, win or lose, I'd find Matt and tell him the truth.

Even if it was too late.

Even if he didn't want to hear it.

Because Betty was right—drowning alone was worse than risking swimming toward something better.

And I was done drowning.
