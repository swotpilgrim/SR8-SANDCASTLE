# Chapter 11: Talking Instead of Competing

Tuesday afternoon brought the kind of lazy beach day that made lifeguarding feel less like vigilance and more like meditation. Light crowds, calm water, families settled contentedly under umbrellas with no apparent interest in testing the ocean's boundaries.

Matt and I sat on our adjacent stands, both scanning our zones out of habit, but the lack of activity meant we could actually talk.

Really talk, for what felt like the first time in three years.

"So," Matt said, breaking a comfortable silence, "tell me something I don't know about you."

"That's a broad request."

"Okay, more specific: why lifeguarding? I know about your father, but there are lots of ways to process grief. Why choose this specifically?"

I thought about how to answer, watching a seagull wheel overhead. "Control, I think. When my dad drowned, I felt completely helpless. Like the ocean was this huge, powerful force that took whatever it wanted, and I had no say in it. Learning to swim, learning to be strong in the water—it gave me back some sense of control. And lifeguarding means I can actually prevent that helpless feeling for other people."

"So it's about power?"

"Not power exactly. Agency, maybe? The ability to make a difference in a specific, tangible way." I looked over at him. "Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense." Matt leaned back against his stand, eyes still scanning the water in that automatic way all good lifeguards develop. "I think that's why my dad loves being a cop. Every day he goes to work knowing he might save someone or stop something bad from happening. That direct impact."

"Is that why you became a lifeguard? Following in his footsteps?"

"Partly. But also—" Matt paused, considering. "I'm the oldest of four brothers. I've been responsible for people my whole life. Mom works shifts at the hospital, Dad works patrol, so I was the one making sure everyone got fed, got to school, didn't kill each other." He smiled. "Lifeguarding felt like a natural extension. Taking care of people is what I do."

I'd never thought about Matt as someone who took care of people. I'd been too busy seeing him as a competitor, an obstacle, someone trying to beat me. This view of him—responsible, caring, protective—added dimensions I hadn't considered.

"That must be hard," I said. "Being the one everyone depends on."

"Sometimes. But it's also satisfying. Like you said—making a tangible difference." He glanced over at me. "Though I think you understand that better than most people. You take care of your mom, right? Since your dad died?"

"How did you know that?"

"Betty mentioned it once. That you help her run the boarding house, that you're more like partners than just mother and daughter."

The fact that Matt had talked to Betty about me, had learned details of my life, had cared enough to remember them—it did something strange to my chest.

"Mom's strong," I said. "Stronger than people give her credit for. But yeah, we're a team. Especially after Dad died. She ran the boarding house, I helped where I could, and we figured out how to be a family of two instead of three."

"That's a lot of responsibility for a twelve-year-old."

"I grew up fast."

"I can tell." Matt's expression was soft. "That's part of what makes you such a good lifeguard. You understand what's at stake. You don't take it lightly."

"Neither do you."

"Thanks." He smiled. "Though I notice we're complimenting each other instead of competing about who takes the job more seriously."

"Is that growth or just a sign we're both tired from Saturday?"

"Maybe both."

We fell into silence again, but it was the easy silence of two people comfortable in each other's presence. I'd never had this with Matt before—this sense of being able to just exist together without constant tension, without every interaction being a test or a challenge.

It was nice. More than nice.

"Your turn," I said. "Tell me something I don't know about you."

Matt thought for a moment, then said, "I hate sprints."

I laughed, surprised. "What? You're amazing at sprints."

"I know. But I hate them. They feel frantic and desperate, like you're running from something instead of toward it. I much prefer distance swimming—the rhythm, the endurance, the mental game of pacing yourself."

"But you always compete in the sprint events."

"Because I'm good at them. Doesn't mean I enjoy them." He grinned. "Not everything we're good at is something we love doing."

"That's unexpectedly philosophical."

"I have depth, Carter."

"Josie," I corrected automatically, then realized what I'd done. Asking him to use my first name, claiming that intimacy.

His expression shifted, became warmer. "Josie," he repeated, like he was savoring the word. "I like saying your name. I've wanted to for three years, but you would have bitten my head off if I'd tried."

"Probably," I admitted. "I wasn't ready."

"And now?"

"Now—" I considered the question honestly. "Now I think maybe I've wasted three years being defensive when I could have been getting to know someone actually worth knowing."

Matt went still, and when he spoke, his voice was quiet and sincere. "That's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late. My ego is already inflating."

I threw my whistle's lanyard at him. He caught it easily, grinning, and threw it back. The playfulness felt revolutionary—we were teasing each other without any edge, without trying to score points or win arguments.

"So," Matt said after returning my whistle, "if you could do anything besides lifeguarding, what would it be?"

"Teaching, maybe. Physical education or swimming instruction. I like the idea of helping people discover what their bodies can do, building their confidence in the water." I hadn't articulated this before, even to myself, but saying it out loud made it feel true. "What about you?"

"Honestly? I'm thinking about following my dad into police work after college. Not immediately—I want to finish my degree first, get some life experience. But eventually, yeah. Helping people, making a difference, all that."

"You'd be good at it. You stay calm under pressure."

"So do you. You could be a cop too if you wanted."

"Me? No way. Too much bureaucracy, too many rules. I need to be outside, near the water." I smiled. "Different kinds of service for different kinds of people."

"But both about helping people."

"Yeah."

A swimmer ventured near the boundary flags, and we both noticed simultaneously. Matt whistled first, signaling them back. The swimmer waved acknowledgment and returned to the safe zone.

"We did that in unison," I observed.

"We see the same things. Think the same way about risk assessment." Matt looked at me thoughtfully. "We're well-matched, Josie. In a lot of ways."

The comment hung in the air between us, weighted with implications I wasn't quite ready to explore. Well-matched. As lifeguards, yes. As friends, maybe. As something more—

I changed the subject. "Tell me about your brothers. You mentioned them but never talk about them specifically."

If Matt noticed my deflection, he didn't call me on it. "Tommy's fourteen—total athlete, plays baseball and basketball, thinks he's invincible. Kevin's twelve—bookish, smart as hell, wants to be a doctor like Mom. And Jamie's nine—he's the wild card, always getting into trouble, charming his way out of it, keeping us all on our toes."

"You miss them during the summer."

"Yeah. But they visit sometimes. Mom's bringing them down for a weekend in August, actually. They'll get to see the competition." He paused. "You could meet them if you want."

Meeting Matt's family felt significant, like crossing another threshold. But the offer was genuine, and I found myself wanting to accept.

"I'd like that."

"Fair warning: they'll probably embarrass me. Tommy thinks he's funnier than he is, and Jamie has no filter whatsoever."

"I grew up with Betty. I'm immune to embarrassing friends."

"These are embarrassing family members. Whole different level."

"I'll risk it."

Matt's smile was soft and genuine. "Good."

The afternoon drifted on. We talked about everything and nothing—favorite movies, books we'd read, music we liked. I learned that Matt loved jazz music, that he'd played trumpet in high school band, that he wanted to visit California someday to surf the Pacific.

He learned that I'd never left the East Coast, that I was terrible at cooking but great at baking, that I'd read The Old Man and the Sea six times because something about Santiago's determination resonated with me.

"Of course you identify with the stubborn old fisherman who won't give up," Matt said, amused.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"You're stubborn and you don't give up. You've got the same kind of determined dignity."

"I'm not sure if that's a compliment or an insult."

"Definitely a compliment. Santiago is a hero."

"He loses the fish."

"But he doesn't lose himself. That's what matters."

The insight surprised me. Matt saw the same thing in the story that I did—that success wasn't always about winning, but about maintaining your integrity through the struggle.

"Have you read it?" I asked.

"Twice. Once for English class, once because I wanted to understand it better."

"Most people hate it."

"Most people miss the point."

We looked at each other across the fifteen feet of sand between our stands, and I felt a click of recognition. This—talking about books and finding we'd read the same things, discovering shared perspectives—this was intimacy of a different kind. Not physical, but intellectual and emotional.

Matt Logan understood me in ways I hadn't expected. And I was starting to understand him too.

"Josie," he said quietly. "I'm really glad we're doing this. Talking, I mean. Getting to know each other."

"Me too."

"I wish we'd done it sooner. We wasted a lot of time being rivals when we could have been—" He stopped, seemed to reconsider his words. "Well. At least we're doing it now."

When we could have been what? Friends? Something more? I wanted to ask but didn't quite dare.

Instead, I said, "Better late than never."

"Yeah."

As the shift ended and we climbed down from our stands, Matt walked with me back to the station instead of heading off with Danny or the other guys like he usually did. The crew noticed—I saw the knowing looks, Betty's delighted wave from the ice cream shop—but I didn't care.

Let them notice. Let them speculate. For the first time in three years, I was spending time with Matt Logan because I wanted to, not because we were forced together by adjacent assignments.

And it felt exactly right.

"Same time tomorrow?" Matt asked as we reached the station.

"I'll be here."

"I know you will." His smile was warm. "You're always here. Reliable, dedicated, never giving up."

"Like Santiago."

"Exactly like Santiago."

I walked home with a lightness I couldn't quite explain, replaying the conversation in my head. We'd talked for hours, and I wanted to keep talking. Wanted to know more, understand more, spend more time in that space where Matt saw me clearly and I saw him back.

Betty was right. My mother was right. Even Danny was right.

This was about more than just friendship.

And I was finally ready to admit it.
