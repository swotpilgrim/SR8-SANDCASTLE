# Chapter 2: The Rival Returns

He arrived mid-morning on Tuesday, and I knew it before I saw him.

The energy on the beach changed. Voices got louder near the lifeguard station, laughter carrying across the sand. I was on stand three, scanning the water with determined focus, pretending I didn't notice the commotion. But I noticed. Of course I noticed.

Matt Logan had that effect—like dropping a stone in still water, the ripples reaching everywhere.

I kept my eyes on the ocean. Two families had set up umbrellas in my zone, children digging moats around ambitious sandcastles. A couple swam in the shallows, staying well within the flags. Safe. Calm. Exactly how I needed things to stay.

"There he is!" Linda's voice drifted up from the beach, bright with enthusiasm. "Matt! Over here!"

My jaw tightened.

I risked a glance toward the station. He stood near Captain Ed, canvas duffel slung over one shoulder, taller and broader than I remembered. His dark hair caught the sunlight as he shook hands with the crew.

Danny clapped him on the back, grinning. Linda practically bounced on her toes, touching his arm as she welcomed him back.

I turned back to the water, throat tight.

Three years. Three summers of Matt Logan disrupting my equilibrium, challenging my competence, getting under my skin with that knowing smirk and those impossible swimming times. I'd had one perfect day without him. One day of peace.

Apparently, that was all I was getting.

"Carter!"

Captain Ed's voice. I looked down to see him waving me over. Matt stood beside him, and even though I couldn't see his expression clearly from this distance, I knew he was watching me.

I climbed down and walked across the sand with deliberate calm. Matt had been here for ten minutes and already I was aware of myself in ways I didn't want to be.

"Carter, Logan's back," Captain Ed said unnecessarily as I approached. "I'm putting him on stand four for the week."

Stand four. Right next to mine.

"Of course, sir." I finally looked at Matt directly. He was tanned, clearly in shape. Matt Logan never did anything halfway, including competing with me.

"Carter." He nodded, expression neutral but eyes sharp. Assessing.

"Logan." I matched his tone exactly—professional, detached, giving nothing away.

"You two going to play nice this summer?" Captain Ed's question wasn't really a question. It was a warning.

"Of course, Captain," Matt said with that easy smile that made everyone else relax. It had never worked on me. I saw through it to the competitive calculation underneath.

"We're professionals, sir," I said.

"Good. Then you won't mind if I assign you the same sectors for safety drills this afternoon. Logan, get settled on your stand. Carter, back to yours."

I turned without another word and walked back to stand three, feeling Matt's eyes on my back the entire way. When I reached my ladder, I heard him climbing the one next to mine. Fifteen feet of sand between platforms. So close I could hear him moving, adjusting his equipment, settling in.

I pulled out my binoculars and scanned the water with exaggerated focus.

"Nice tan," Matt called over. "Training hard over the winter?"

I didn't look at him. "Always."

"Swim times improve?"

"Naturally."

"Beat your two-hundred-meter record?"

Now I did look at him, irritation flashing hot. He was leaning against his platform railing, all casual confidence, watching me with that expression I knew too well—half challenge, half amusement. Like this was a game.

"By four seconds," I said coolly. "You?"

"Five." His grin widened. "Guess we'll see who's really faster."

"We already know who's faster. I beat you last summer in the distance trials."

"By half a length. And I beat you in sprints."

"Sprints are about explosion, not endurance. Any decent lifeguard knows endurance matters more."

"Any decent lifeguard knows you need both." Matt shrugged, still smiling. "But sure, keep telling yourself distance is all that counts."

Heat rose in my chest. This was exactly what he did—turned every conversation into a competition, every statement into a challenge. Three minutes back on the beach and he already had me defensive and prickly.

I turned back to my water without responding, gripping my binoculars harder than necessary.

The morning stretched on with uncomfortable awareness of Matt beside me. I heard every movement—the creak of his stand, the scratch of pencil on paper, the low whistle when a swimmer ventured near the boundary flags. It still drove me crazy.

Around eleven, Danny climbed up Matt's stand to talk. Their voices carried in the salt air.

"Good to have you back, man," Danny said. "How's Philadelphia?"

"Hot. Crowded. Not enough ocean."

"Your brothers doing okay?"

"Growing like weeds. Mom says they're eating her out of house and home." Matt laughed, and something about the genuine warmth in it made my chest tighten. "How's the crew this year?"

"Same as ever. Captain Ed's in fine form. Linda's been practicing her rescue carries. Brennan—one of the new guys—already got chewed out for questioning whether girls should be lifeguards."

I heard the shift in Matt's voice. "What'd he say?"

"Doesn't matter. Captain Ed shut him down hard. Josie didn't even blink."

"She wouldn't."

The way he said my first name—like he knew me, like we were familiar—sent an odd shiver down my spine. I kept my eyes fixed on the water, pretending I wasn't listening.

"You two going to compete over everything again this year?" Danny asked, amusement clear in his tone.

"Probably. It's tradition at this point."

"You know there are other ways to get a girl's attention."

"Who says I want her attention?"

"Matt, come on. You've been—"

"Water!" I blew my whistle sharply, cutting off their conversation. A swimmer had drifted beyond the flags—a teenager showing off for friends, not watching the boundary markers. I signaled him back with sharp hand motions.

The kid waved acknowledgment and swam back into the safe zone. I logged the incident, aware that both Danny and Matt had gone quiet.

"Nice catch," Matt called over once Danny had climbed down.

I didn't respond.

Noon brought shift rotation. I was scheduled for lunch while Matt covered both zones temporarily. When I passed his stand on my way to the station, he looked down at me.

"Betty working today?"

I stopped, surprised he remembered my best friend's name. "The ice cream shop. Why?"

"Just wondering if she still makes those amazing sundaes."

"She works at an ice cream shop. Of course she makes sundaes."

"You're awfully prickly today, Carter."

"You're awfully chatty for someone who just arrived, Logan."

His expression flickered—something that might have been hurt or frustration before the easy smile returned. "Just trying to be friendly."

"We're not friends. We're colleagues."

"Right." The smile faded. "Wouldn't want to forget that."

I walked away feeling somehow like I'd lost that exchange, though I couldn't say how.

Betty found me at the station during lunch, taking one look at my face and immediately guessing. "He's back, isn't he?"

"Stand four."

"Next to yours."

"Yep."

"And you two are being mature adults about it?"

I bit into my sandwich without answering.

Betty sighed. "Josie. You can't keep treating him like the enemy."

"We work together fine. We just don't have to like each other."

"Do you even remember why you don't like him?"

The question caught me off guard. The joke from three years ago felt distant now, but the feeling remained—that Matt Logan saw me as competition to beat rather than equal to respect.

"He's condescending," I said finally.

"He asked about my sundaes. That's condescending?"

"You don't understand."

"You're right, I don't." Betty stood, brushing sand from her skirt. "But I do understand that holding grudges makes you miserable, and you've been miserable every summer since Matt Logan arrived. Maybe it's time to ask yourself why."

She left before I could respond.

The afternoon brought rescue drills, which meant working in close proximity with Matt. Captain Ed paired us deliberately—I could tell by the glint in his eye when he made the assignments.

"Carter and Logan, you're team one. Sullivan and Hayes, team two. New recruits, you'll observe and learn."

The drill was standard: simulated unconscious swimmer at a marked distance, timed rescue and return, proper carrying technique and beach landing. Matt and I had done this dozens of times, usually trying to outpace each other.

Today felt different.

We entered the water simultaneously, both diving cleanly off the beach. I swam hard, arms cutting through the calm surf, legs kicking in perfect rhythm. I could feel Matt beside me—not ahead, not behind, exactly even. Our strokes matched pace for pace.

We reached the buoy marking our "victim" at the same moment.

"I've got the carry," I said.

"I'm stronger—"

"I've got it." I maneuvered into position for the cross-chest carry, professional and efficient.

But Matt had already positioned himself on the opposite side. Instead of arguing, he adapted, and together we executed a two-person rescue carry, something typically reserved for larger victims or rough conditions.

We swam back in perfect synchronization, our movements coordinated without discussion. Years of training—and yes, years of competing—meant we knew each other's techniques, rhythms, strengths. We moved like partners who'd drilled together for ages.

We were the fastest team by twelve seconds.

Captain Ed nodded approval. "That's textbook execution. Everyone else, watch how they communicate non-verbally. That's what training and experience look like."

The crew watched us, and I saw the understanding in their eyes—Josie and Matt might not get along, but they were the best on this beach.

We stood there, breathing hard, water streaming off our shoulders, and for a moment I let myself look at Matt. Really look at him. The set of his jaw, the rise and fall of his chest, the way water droplets clung to his eyelashes. He looked back, and something passed between us that wasn't competition or hostility.

Recognition, maybe. Of skill. Of partnership potential.

Then he smirked. "Not bad, Carter. For a distance swimmer."

The moment shattered. "You're welcome for carrying your weight, Logan."

"I—what? You didn't—" He stopped, apparently seeing the satisfaction in my face at getting a rise out of him. "You're impossible."

"Funny, I was thinking the same about you."

We walked back to our respective stands, the brief moment of connection already buried under familiar antagonism.

But as I climbed my ladder and settled back into position, I caught myself glancing at stand four. Matt was writing in his log book, profile sharp against the afternoon sun, completely focused on his task.

He looked up suddenly, catching me watching. Our eyes met.

I looked away first, cursing myself.

This was going to be a very long summer.
