# Chapter 18: Cold Distance

The following week felt like living underwater—everything muffled and distant and wrong.

Matt stopped trying to reach me beyond the bare minimum required for work. No more morning conversations. No more jokes called across the space between our stands. No more walks after shift or shared lunches or stolen glances that made my stomach flip.

Just professional courtesy and cold efficiency.

I told myself this was what I'd wanted. Safety. Distance. The comfortable territory of competition where feelings couldn't ambush me. But comfort turned out to be another word for miserable.

Every morning, I'd arrive at the beach and see Matt already there, and my heart would lift hopefully—only to crash when he'd nod once in acknowledgment and turn away without speaking. We'd climb to our respective stands and work through our shifts in silence broken only by necessary communication.

"Swimmer drifting north section."

"I see them."

"Small child alone in shallows."

"Got it."

Functional. Professional. Absolutely devoid of warmth.

The crew noticed. Of course they noticed. We'd gone from obviously falling for each other to obviously avoiding each other, and the shift was painfully visible.

Danny stopped trying to get Matt to talk about it after the third day. "I'm done," he told Matt loudly enough for me to overhear. "You've got a right to be hurt. She led you on, opened up, then slammed the door in your face. You don't owe her anything."

Matt just nodded, his expression carefully neutral.

I wanted to argue, to defend myself, to explain that I hadn't meant to hurt him. But I had no defense. Danny was right. I'd done exactly what he described.

Linda, meanwhile, seemed to sense an opening.

"Want company at lunch?" she asked Matt on Wednesday, her smile sympathetic and slightly predatory.

"Sure," Matt said without hesitation.

They sat together on the sand while I ate alone at my stand, watching them talk and laugh. Linda touched Matt's arm as she spoke. He smiled at her—not the bright, genuine smile I'd gotten used to seeing, but a smile nonetheless.

Jealousy twisted in my gut, sharp and acidic. I had no right to feel it. I'd pushed him away. If he found comfort with Linda, that was my fault.

But watching them together hurt worse than anything I'd tried to protect myself from.

Training for the competition continued with grim determination. Matt ran every morning—I saw him from my bedroom window, jogging the beach before dawn. I ran too, deliberately timing my route to avoid crossing paths with him.

We practiced rescue techniques with other partners now. I worked with Betty, who was patient but clearly disappointed in me. Matt worked with Danny, their coordination good but lacking the perfect synchronization we'd had.

During drills, Captain Ed paired us once. We executed a complex rescue scenario—multiple victims, rough conditions, split-second coordination required. We did it flawlessly, faster than any other pair, moving like we shared one mind.

But afterward, we returned to our separate corners without celebration or acknowledgment. The crew watched with a mix of admiration and sadness.

"They're incredible together," I heard one of the new guards say.

"Yeah," Danny replied. "Too bad they're too stubborn to see it."

Thursday evening, Captain Ed called me into his office after shift.

"Sit," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

I sat.

He studied me for a long moment, then sighed. "You want to tell me what's going on between you and Logan?"

"Nothing, sir. We're fine."

"You're not fine. You're both miserable, and it's affecting crew morale. Matt's throwing himself into training like he's got something to prove or something to forget. You look like you haven't slept in days. And when you work together, it's technically perfect but emotionally dead. So I'll ask again: what happened?"

I stared at my hands. "I made a mistake."

"What kind of mistake?"

"The kind where you get scared of something good and push it away because you're too broken to accept it."

Captain Ed was quiet, then said gently, "Josie, you're not broken. You're healing. There's a difference."

The same words my mother had used. Why did everyone seem to understand this except me?

"I don't know how to fix it," I admitted.

"Have you tried apologizing?"

"He won't talk to me beyond work communication."

"Can you blame him?"

"No."

Captain Ed leaned back in his chair. "Let me tell you something about Matt Logan. He's been working for me for three summers, and in all that time, I've never seen him give up on something important. Not a difficult rescue, not a struggling new guard, not a seemingly impossible goal. He tries, and tries again, and doesn't quit."

"I know."

"But he quit trying with you. Do you understand what that means?"

"That he's done with me."

"That you hurt him badly enough to break something that doesn't break easily." Captain Ed's expression was serious. "That boy had patience for three years while you held onto your grudge. He waited, competed with you, respected you, and when you finally let him in, he loved you without reservation. And you threw it back in his face."

The words landed like blows. "I know."

"So the question is: are you going to do something about it, or are you going to let pride and fear cost you the best thing that's happened to you?"

"I don't know if he'll forgive me."

"You won't know unless you try."

After I left Captain Ed's office, I walked the beach alone, watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink. This spot—our spot, where we'd sat after the rescue and started really seeing each other—felt haunted by possibilities I'd destroyed.

I thought about Matt's patience, his kindness, the way he'd waited three years for me to stop being angry and let him in. The way he'd listened when I talked about my father, the way he'd asked permission before trying to kiss me, the way he'd been willing to go slow and give me time to be ready.

And I'd repaid all of that by running away the first time vulnerability felt too real.

Danny was right. Matt had every right to be done with me.

But Captain Ed was also right. I wouldn't know if there was any chance of forgiveness unless I tried.

The problem was finding the courage to try.

Friday brought more of the same—cold efficiency, painful silence, work that was technically excellent but emotionally hollow. I watched Matt from across the space between our stands and ached for what we'd briefly had.

During afternoon shift, a family approached with a small boy clutching a toy boat. The mother asked if we'd autograph it—her son wanted signatures from "the two lifeguards who saved that boy from the riptide."

The family had heard the story somehow, probably from Captain Ed or one of the crew. They didn't know that the lifeguards who'd worked in perfect partnership that day were now strangers who barely spoke.

Matt and I signed the toy boat in awkward silence while the little boy watched with hero worship in his eyes.

"You're a team!" he said excitedly. "Like superheroes!"

"Something like that," Matt said quietly.

After they left, we stood there for a moment, the toy boat's message echoing between us: *We're a team*.

Except we weren't. Not anymore.

Matt returned to his stand without a word.

That evening, Betty found me at home, lying on my bed staring at the ceiling.

"I've been patient," she said, sitting on the edge of my bed. "I've given you space to figure this out on your own. But Josie, it's been a week, and you're not figuring anything out. You're just getting more miserable."

"I don't know what to do."

"Yes, you do. You apologize. You explain. You ask for another chance."

"What if he says no?"

"Then at least you tried. At least you were brave enough to risk rejection instead of just accepting loss." Betty took my hand. "You told me once that being a lifeguard means diving into dangerous water to save people. You don't hesitate. You just go. Why can't you do that with Matt?"

"Because failed rescues in water mean someone drowns. Failed rescues with hearts mean I drown."

"You're already drowning, Josie. You're already miserable. The only difference is whether you drown alone or whether you at least try to swim toward something better first."

She was right. They were all right—my mother, Captain Ed, Betty. I was choosing loneliness over risk, fear over courage, drowning over swimming.

But knowing what I should do and finding the strength to do it were still two very different things.

Saturday morning, I woke early and sat at my window watching the sunrise. Down on the beach, a lone figure ran through the pre-dawn gray. Matt, keeping to his training schedule, preparing for the competition that was now only one week away.

One week until the competition.

One week to find my courage.

One week to fix what I'd broken, or accept I'd lost him forever.

I watched him run until he disappeared around the jetty, and made a decision.

I would compete. I would give it everything I had. And after the competition—win or lose—I would find Matt and tell him the truth.

That I loved him.

That I was sorry.

That I was terrified but willing to try.

And if he told me it was too late, that I'd hurt him too badly, that he was done waiting for me to be brave enough?

Then at least I'd have tried.

At least I wouldn't spend the rest of my life wondering what might have happened if I'd just been honest about my feelings one more time.

The decision settled something in me. Not peace—not yet. But at least a direction. A plan.

One more week of this cold distance.

Then I'd dive into the dangerous water and pray I'd survive.
