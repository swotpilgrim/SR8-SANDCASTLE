# Chapter 14: Evening Walk

Saturday evening, after our shift ended, Matt asked if I wanted to walk to the jetty. It wasn't really a question—we both knew I'd say yes. We'd been gravitating toward each other all day, finding excuses to talk, stealing glances across the space between our stands, counting down the hours until we could be alone together.

The crew had definitely noticed.

"You two are disgustingly cute," Linda said as we packed up our equipment. "Just so you know."

"We're not trying to be cute," I protested.

"That's what makes it worse. You're naturally disgustingly cute. It's offensive to those of us who have to work at it."

Matt laughed, slinging his arm around my shoulders in a gesture so casual and natural it made my heart squeeze. "Sorry, Hayes. We'll try to be less cute."

"Don't bother. You'll fail." But Linda was smiling. "Seriously though—I'm happy for you both. You make sense together."

As we walked away from the station, I leaned into Matt's side. "We make sense together?"

"Apparently. Though I could have told you that three years ago."

"I wasn't ready to hear it three years ago."

"No," he agreed, kissing the top of my head. "But you're ready now. That's what matters."

The evening was perfect—warm but not hot, the sun beginning its descent toward the horizon, painting the sky in shades of peach and gold. The beach was emptying out, families packing up their umbrellas and towels, couples walking the waterline hand in hand. We joined them, our fingers twined together, walking at an easy pace.

"Tell me about Rutgers," I said. "What are you studying?"

"Criminal justice. Pre-law focus. My dad wanted me to have options—I can go into police work or continue to law school, depending on what I decide." Matt glanced at me. "What about you? Have you thought about college?"

"Some. Money's tight with the boarding house, but I've been saving. I'm thinking maybe a state school, education degree." I hesitated, then admitted, "I haven't talked to my mom about it seriously yet. I think she worries about managing the boarding house alone."

"You don't have to stay in Marina Bay just because of your mom's business."

"I know. But she's all I have, Matt. After Dad died, it's been just us. The idea of leaving her—" I stopped, struggling with the guilt that thought always brought.

Matt squeezed my hand. "Have you asked her what she wants for you?"

"Not directly."

"Maybe you should. I bet she wants you to live your life, pursue your dreams. Parents usually do."

He was probably right. But the conversation with my mother felt like something for later, after I'd figured out what my dreams actually were.

We reached the jetty as the sun touched the horizon. The rocks were warm under our hands as we climbed, finding our usual spot near the end where the ocean stretched out endlessly before us. This place had become significant—where we'd had our first real conversation about training, where we'd both acknowledged the change between us, where so many important moments had unfolded.

"I love it here," I said, sitting down and letting my legs dangle over the edge. The water rushed around the rocks below, foamy and white.

Matt sat beside me, close enough that our shoulders touched. "Me too. It feels like ours somehow."

"Our jetty?"

"Our jetty," he confirmed with a smile. "Where Josie Carter finally stopped hating Matt Logan and started tolerating him instead."

"I never hated you."

"You did a very good impression of it."

I leaned my head on his shoulder. "I hated how you made me feel. That's different."

"How did I make you feel?"

"Unsettled. Aware. Like all my carefully constructed defenses were transparent and you could see right through them to the scared girl underneath." I watched the waves crash against the rocks. "It was easier to pretend I hated you than to admit you saw me that clearly."

"I did see you. I always saw you." Matt's arm came around my waist, holding me close. "That's why I couldn't give up, even when you pushed me away. I knew the rivalry was a shield, and underneath was someone worth knowing."

"You're very patient."

"When it comes to you? Infinitely patient."

We sat in comfortable silence, watching the sunset paint the sky in increasingly brilliant colors. The ocean rolled in steady and eternal, indifferent to human dramas and teenage romance, just doing what it had done for millions of years.

"Matt?"

"Yeah?"

"What happens at the end of summer? When you go back to Philadelphia and I stay here?"

The question had been lurking in the back of my mind since yesterday, since we'd admitted our feelings. Summer had to end eventually. And when it did, what happened to us?

Matt was quiet for a moment, considering. "I'll be in Philadelphia, yeah. But it's not that far. Couple hours by bus. I can come down on weekends sometimes. And you could visit me—I'd love to show you the city, introduce you to my family."

"Long distance is hard."

"It is," he agreed. "But we're not any relationship, Josie. We're us. We've competed at the highest level, saved lives together, worked through three years of misunderstanding. If we can do all that, we can handle a couple hours of distance."

"You make it sound simple."

"It won't be simple. There will be hard days and missed calls and wishing we were together when we're apart." Matt turned to look at me directly. "But I'd rather have hard days with you than easy days with anyone else."

My eyes stung with unexpected tears. "How do you always know exactly what to say?"

"Practice. I've been writing speeches to you in my head for three years." He wiped a tear from my cheek with his thumb. "Don't cry, Josie. We'll figure it out. Together."

"Together," I repeated, trying out the word. It still felt new and slightly frightening, but also right.

"Besides," Matt added with a grin, "we still have six weeks of summer left. That's a lot of time."

"And the competition."

"And the competition," he agreed. "Which we're still both planning to win."

I pulled back to look at him. "You know one of us is going to lose, right?"

"Maybe. Or maybe we'll tie again and Captain Ed will have to award two trophies." Matt's expression turned serious. "But honestly? Winning doesn't matter as much as it used to. Not compared to this."

"Don't say that. You've trained so hard—"

"And I'll still compete hard. I want to do my best, push myself, show what I'm capable of. But if you win, Josie, I'll be genuinely happy for you. Because you deserve it. You're an incredible lifeguard, and you've earned that recognition."

"If you win, I'll be happy for you too," I said, and was surprised to find it true. The desperate need to beat Matt, to prove myself superior, had faded. I still wanted to win—my competitive nature hadn't disappeared. But the stakes felt different now. Lower, somehow.

Or maybe just more balanced. Winning would be great. But I'd already won the thing that mattered most.

"Look," Matt said, pointing at the horizon.

The sun was halfway below the water line, the sky ablaze with crimson and orange and purple. The ocean reflected the colors like liquid fire, and for a moment the entire world seemed painted in light.

"It's beautiful," I breathed.

"Yeah." But when I looked at Matt, he was looking at me, not the sunset.

"You're supposed to be watching the sunset."

"I'd rather watch you watching the sunset."

"That's incredibly cheesy."

"I know. But it's true." Matt tucked a strand of hair behind my ear, his touch gentle. "Josie Carter, you're the most beautiful person I've ever known. And I don't just mean your face—though that's pretty great too. I mean your strength, your determination, your courage. The way you dive into dangerous water without hesitation. The way you refuse to give up, even when things are hard. The way you're learning to let me in, even though it scares you."

"Matt—"

"I know we're taking things slow. I know you need time. But I wanted you to know that I see all of you—not just the tough lifeguard exterior, but the vulnerable, brave, beautiful person underneath. And I love all of it."

I kissed him. It was the only response that felt adequate to a declaration like that. Our second kiss was deeper than the first, more confident, full of feeling I didn't have words for. Matt's hand cradled the back of my head, and I felt safe and treasured and seen.

When we pulled apart, both of us were breathless.

"I love you," I said. "I know I said it yesterday, but I want to keep saying it. I love you, Matt Logan."

"I love you, Josie Carter." His smile was radiant. "And I promise I'll never make you regret trusting me with that."

We sat on the jetty until the sun disappeared completely and stars began to emerge in the darkening sky. Matt told me stories about his brothers—Tommy's baseball mishaps, Kevin's scientific experiments that went wrong, Jamie's elaborate schemes to avoid bedtime. I told him about life at the boarding house, about my mother's guests and the small dramas of running a business.

We talked about everything and nothing, comfortable in each other's presence, building the foundation of something that could last beyond summer.

Eventually, we climbed down from the jetty and walked back along the beach, still hand in hand. The boardwalk was lit up now, music drifting from the arcade, couples and families enjoying the evening. We stopped at Kowalski's where Betty served us ice cream with a knowing smile and refused to let us pay.

"Consider it a celebration," she said. "My best friend finally got her head out of her stubborn behind and fell in love. That deserves free ice cream."

"Thanks, Betty," I said, laughing.

"Anytime. You two are my favorite success story."

As we walked me home to the boarding house, I felt something I hadn't felt in years: complete contentment. No anxiety about the future, no fear of loss, no walls between me and happiness. Just this moment, this person, this feeling.

Matt walked me to the front door, both of us reluctant to say goodnight.

"See you tomorrow?" he asked.

"Six a.m. We both have morning shift."

"I'll be there." He kissed me softly. "Sweet dreams, Josie."

"Sweet dreams, Matt."

I watched him walk away until he disappeared around the corner, then went inside where my mother was waiting in the kitchen with tea and a knowing expression.

"Good evening?" she asked.

"The best evening," I said, unable to stop smiling.

"I'm glad, sweetheart." She patted the chair beside her. "Come tell me about it."

And I did. I told her about Matt, about how wrong I'd been, about learning to be vulnerable, about falling in love. She listened with the patience of someone who'd been waiting for this conversation for a long time.

When I finished, she squeezed my hand. "Your father would be proud of you. Not because you fell in love, but because you were brave enough to let yourself be happy."

That night, I fell asleep thinking about Matt—his smile, his patience, his faith in me. And for the first time since my father died, the ocean outside my window sounded like promise instead of threat.

Tomorrow would bring another day of lifeguarding, more training for the competition, more time with Matt. The summer would end eventually, and we'd face whatever challenges came with distance and time.

But tonight, I was simply happy. And that was enough.
