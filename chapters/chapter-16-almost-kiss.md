# Chapter 16: Almost Kiss

Wednesday evening, Matt asked me to Kowalski's Ice Cream Parlor after our shift. Not casually, not as friends grabbing a snack between duties. He asked me on a date.

"I'd like to take you out," he said, his voice careful but hopeful. "Properly. Ice cream, maybe a walk after. What do you say?"

My heart did that flip it had been doing constantly since we'd admitted our feelings. "I'd like that."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

His smile could have powered the boardwalk lights.

We walked to Betty's family shop as the sun began its descent, our hands swinging between us. The boardwalk was busy with evening crowds—families, teenagers, couples enjoying the warm August air.

Betty spotted us immediately, her face lighting up. "Well, well, well," she said, grinning. "Look who's here on an actual date."

"Betty," I warned.

"What? I'm allowed to be happy for my best friend." She grabbed two menus. "Your usual booth is available. What can I get you two lovebirds?"

"We're not—" I started.

"We'll share the chocolate-strawberry sundae," Matt said, his arm sliding around my waist like it belonged there. "Extra whipped cream."

"Coming right up!" Betty practically bounced away, and I could see her whispering excitedly to her mother behind the counter.

We slid into the booth—chrome edged, red vinyl seats. The jukebox played "Only You" by The Platters, and the scene felt impossibly perfect.

"She's never going to let us live this down," I said.

"Worth it, though." Matt reached across and took my hand.

Betty returned with the sundae—a towering creation of chocolate and strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, cherries, and two long spoons.

"Enjoy, lovebirds. And Josie? I'm really, really happy for you."

After she left, Matt and I dug into the sundae, our spoons occasionally colliding. Each time, we'd laugh, and I felt lighter than I had in years.

"Tell me about your brothers," I said. "Really tell me, not just the highlights."

Matt's face softened the way it always did when he talked about his family. "Tommy's the athlete—thinks he's going to play professional baseball someday. He probably could, too, if he'd stop showing off and focus on fundamentals. Kevin is the complete opposite—would rather be in a library than on a field. Mom says he's going to cure cancer or discover a new planet. And Jamie—" Matt laughed. "Jamie is pure chaos. Charming, manipulative, too smart for his own good. He'll either end up president or in jail."

"You love them a lot."

"More than anything. Being away from them all summer is the hardest part of this job." He took a bite of ice cream, then added, "But meeting you made it worth it."

My cheeks heated. "Smooth talker."

"Just honest." Matt's eyes held mine. "Tell me about your dad. You've mentioned he died, but you've never really talked about him. What was he like?"

The question caught me off guard. Most people avoided the topic of my father, uncomfortable with grief, uncertain how to navigate the conversation. But Matt asked like he genuinely wanted to know, like my father mattered to him because he mattered to me.

"He was funny," I said slowly, memories surfacing. "Always making terrible puns that made me and Mom groan. He loved the ocean—we'd come to the shore every summer for vacation. He'd swim out farther than anyone else, and I'd watch from the beach and think he was the bravest person in the world."

"He sounds wonderful."

"He was. Losing him—" My voice caught. "It broke something in me. Or maybe it just revealed something that was already fragile. I couldn't protect him, couldn't save him, couldn't do anything except watch my mother fall apart and try to be strong enough for both of us."

Matt squeezed my hand. "That's a lot for a twelve-year-old to carry."

"I didn't know how else to be. And then I got older and realized being strong meant never needing anyone, never being vulnerable, never risking that kind of loss again." I looked at our joined hands. "Until you."

"Until me?"

"Until you made me want to risk it again."

The ice cream sat forgotten between us as Matt lifted my hand and kissed my knuckles gently. "Thank you for trusting me with that."

We finished the sundae talking about everything—his plans for law school, my dreams of teaching, books we'd read, movies we wanted to see. The conversation flowed like it had been doing for weeks now, easy and natural, punctuated by laughter and comfortable silences.

When we finally left Kowalski's, the boardwalk lights were all lit up, casting everything in a warm glow. Matt led me away from the crowds, toward the marina where his aunt and uncle's business was located.

"I want to show you something," he said.

The marina was quieter than the boardwalk—gentle sounds of water lapping boats, creaking wood and rope, distant seagulls. The moon hung full and bright, its reflection dancing on the water. Boats bobbed in their slips.

"My uncle says every boat has a personality," Matt said, guiding me down the main dock.

"Which one's yours?" I asked. "If you were a boat?"

Matt considered, then pointed to a sturdy fishing boat. "That one. Not fancy, but dependable. Built to weather storms."

"I like that one. It looks honest."

We walked to the end of the longest dock where the bay opened before us, moonlight turning the water silver. Matt turned to face me, and suddenly the air felt charged with something electric and frightening and wonderful.

"Josie," he said softly.

"Yeah?"

"I'm going to ask you something, and I need you to answer honestly, okay?"

My heart hammered. "Okay."

"Can I kiss you?"

The question hung in the air between us. His hand came up to cup my face, thumb brushing my cheekbone, and I could see the want in his eyes, the hope, the fear that I might say no.

I wanted to say yes. Desperately wanted it. Wanted to lean into his touch, close the distance between us, find out what his lips felt like against mine.

But the wanting terrified me.

Because if I kissed him, that made this real. Made us real. Made me vulnerable in a way I'd sworn I'd never be again. If I kissed him, I was admitting I needed him, depended on him, would be devastated if I lost him.

And I couldn't—I couldn't risk that kind of pain again.

"I—" My voice came out strangled. "I should get home. My mother, she'll be waiting, and I have early shift tomorrow—"

I stepped back, breaking the contact of his hand on my face. Matt's expression shifted from hope to confusion to hurt so quickly it made my chest ache.

"Josie—"

"Thank you for tonight. It was really nice. I'll see you tomorrow."

I was already turning, already walking away, already running like the coward I'd sworn I wasn't.

"Josie, wait—"

But I didn't wait. I walked quickly down the dock, then broke into a jog once I hit the boardwalk, not stopping until I was three blocks away and couldn't see the marina anymore.

Then I stopped, leaning against a streetlamp, and let the tears come.

What was wrong with me? Matt was perfect. Tonight had been perfect. He'd listened to me talk about my father without judgment, shared his family stories, asked permission before trying to kiss me—which was respectful and sweet and exactly what I should have wanted.

And I'd panicked.

Run away from the best thing that had ever happened to me because I was too scared to be happy, too broken to accept love, too damaged to let someone get close.

I walked the rest of the way home in tears, hating myself, hating my fear, hating that I could see Matt's hurt expression every time I closed my eyes.

My mother was reading in the living room when I came in. She took one look at my face and set down her book.

"Sweetheart? What happened?"

"I ruined everything," I said, fresh tears spilling over.

She pulled me into a hug, letting me cry on her shoulder like I hadn't done since I was twelve years old. When the sobs finally subsided, she guided me to the couch and made me tell her the whole story.

"Matt asked to kiss you," she said when I finished, "and you panicked."

"I ran away like a scared child."

"You ran away like a scared young woman who's been protecting her heart for five years." My mother took my hand. "Josie, there's nothing wrong with being scared. But running away from something good because you're afraid of losing it—that's not protection. That's just choosing loneliness over risk."

"What if I can't do this? What if I'm too broken?"

"You're not broken. You're healing. There's a difference." She brushed hair from my face. "Your father would want you to be happy, sweetheart. He'd want you to love and be loved. He wouldn't want you to spend your life afraid."

"I know. Logically, I know that. But when Matt touched me, when he asked to kiss me—I just felt everything I'd be risking if I said yes. And it was too much."

"Then maybe," my mother said gently, "you need to think about what you're risking if you say no. You're so focused on protecting yourself from potential future pain that you're causing yourself actual present pain. Is that really better?"

I didn't have an answer.

That night, I lay in bed replaying the evening—the sundae at Kowalski's, the conversation about my father, the moonlit marina, Matt's gentle touch on my face, his hurt expression when I pulled away.

I'd told myself for years that being strong meant never needing anyone. That independence was the only safe path, that vulnerability would destroy me.

But lying there in the dark, I realized something: I was already destroyed. Not by loving Matt, but by refusing to love him. By choosing fear over happiness, walls over connection, safety over actually living.

Tomorrow I'd see him at the beach. Tomorrow I'd have to face what I'd done, the hurt I'd caused, the perfect moment I'd ruined because I was too scared to be brave.

And I had no idea how to fix it.

But I knew I had to try.

Because Matt Logan had asked if he could kiss me, and I'd said no.

And that might have been the biggest mistake of my life.
