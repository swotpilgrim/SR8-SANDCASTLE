# Chapter 17: Reverting to Old Patterns

Thursday morning, I arrived at the beach with my walls rebuilt higher and stronger than before.

I'd spent the night convincing myself that running from Matt had been the right choice. Smart. Self-protective. The only sensible response to feelings that threatened to consume me. By the time dawn broke, I'd constructed an entire narrative: we'd gotten caught up in the moment, confused partnership for romance, let physical proximity cloud our judgment.

The rivalry had been real. The competition had been healthy. What we'd had before—that distant, safe antagonism—that was what we should return to.

Never mind that my chest ached. Never mind that I'd cried myself to sleep. Never mind that every cell in my body was screaming that I'd made a terrible mistake.

Matt was already at the lifeguard station when I arrived. He looked up as I approached, and hope flashed across his face before he saw my expression and it died.

"Josie," he said carefully. "About last night—"

"I think we need to refocus," I interrupted, my voice crisp and professional. "We've been distracted lately. The competition is only two weeks away, and we should be training, not—" I gestured vaguely between us. "Not whatever we've been doing."

Matt stared at me. "Whatever we've been doing?"

"You know what I mean. We let things get confused. The partnership from the rescue, spending time together—it was nice, but we lost sight of why we're here. We're competitors, Logan. That's what we've always been."

The use of his last name landed like a slap. I saw him flinch.

"So that's it?" His voice was tight. "Last night you're telling me about your father, I'm asking to kiss you, and today we're back to competitors? Just like that?"

"It's better this way."

"Better for who?"

"For both of us." The lie tasted bitter. "Look, we got caught up in something that wasn't real. Let's just—let's focus on the job and the competition. That's what matters."

"The competition." Matt's laugh was harsh. "Right. Because that's all we've ever been about. Competition."

"Yes."

"You're lying."

"I'm being realistic."

"You're being a coward."

The word hit like a punch. "Excuse me?"

"You heard me. Last night you got scared of something real and meaningful, and now you're running back to the safety of rivalry because that's easier than actually letting someone in." Matt's eyes were bright with hurt and anger. "I thought you were braver than this, Josie."

"Don't—" My voice shook. "Don't act like you know me."

"I do know you. That's what terrifies you."

I turned away before he could see the tears threatening. "I have to get to my stand."

"Fine. Run away. That's what you do best."

I climbed to stand three and sat down heavily, gripping the wooden rail until my knuckles went white. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't give him the satisfaction of seeing you break.

But my vision blurred anyway.

Matt climbed to stand four in silence. The space between our platforms—fifteen feet that had felt like nothing when we were talking and laughing—now felt like an ocean.

The morning shift was torture. Every time I glanced over, Matt was deliberately not looking at me. His jaw was set, his shoulders tense, and I could feel the anger and hurt radiating from him even across the distance.

This was what I'd wanted, I reminded myself. Distance. Safety. The familiar territory of competition where feelings couldn't hurt me.

So why did it feel like I was drowning?

Around ten, Danny climbed up to Matt's stand. I couldn't hear their conversation, but I saw Danny's concerned expression, saw Matt shake his head and say something that made Danny look over at me with disappointment clear on his face.

I looked away quickly, pretending to be focused on the water.

At noon, Betty appeared at the base of my stand, arms crossed and expression stormy.

"Get down here," she said. "Now."

I climbed down, and she immediately pulled me toward the equipment shed where we'd have privacy.

"What did you do?" she demanded.

"I don't know what you—"

"Don't. Danny just told me Matt tried to kiss you last night and you ran away. Then this morning you told him you should just be competitors. After everything—after finally admitting your feelings, after being happy for the first time in years—you're throwing it away?"

"It's complicated."

"It's not complicated. You're scared, so you're sabotaging the best thing that's ever happened to you."

"You don't understand—"

"I understand perfectly. You've been terrified of being vulnerable since your dad died, and the second Matt got close to breaking through your walls, you panicked and rebuilt them higher." Betty grabbed my shoulders. "Josie, I love you, but you're being an idiot."

"I can't do this, Betty. I can't be that open, that vulnerable. What if I need him and he leaves? What if I love him and lose him? I can't—" My voice broke. "I can't survive that again."

"So instead you're choosing to lose him now? You think that hurts less?"

"Yes! At least this way I have control. At least this way I'm choosing it."

Betty's expression softened. "Oh, honey. You're not choosing it. You're just running from it. And Matt's going to stop waiting eventually. He's going to realize you're never going to let him in, and he's going to move on. Is that really what you want?"

"I don't know what I want," I admitted, tears finally spilling over.

"Yes, you do. You want Matt. You want to be with him, to be loved by him, to let yourself love him back. You just don't want to risk getting hurt." She squeezed my shoulders. "But Josie? You're already hurting. You're already miserable. And you're making him miserable too. At least if you took the risk, you might get to be happy first."

I didn't have an answer to that.

The rest of my shift passed in mechanical silence. I scanned the water, blew my whistle when swimmers ventured too far out, logged my observations—all on autopilot while my mind churned.

Matt stayed on his stand, equally mechanical. We didn't speak. Didn't look at each other. Worked with cold professional efficiency that would have made Captain Ed proud if he didn't keep shooting us concerned glances.

Near the end of shift, a swimmer got caught in a moderate riptide. Matt and I responded simultaneously—old instincts kicking in despite the personal tension. We coordinated the rescue perfectly, moving in sync, communicating with hand signals and brief functional words.

"I've got her."

"Coming from your six."

"Parallel first."

"On three."

We brought the swimmer back safely, and she thanked us both effusively. But the moment she was on shore, Matt and I returned to our respective stands without a word.

We could still work together. We were still an excellent team.

But the warmth was gone. The partnership felt hollow. And the efficiency just highlighted how much we'd lost.

As shift ended and I climbed down from my stand, I saw Matt walking toward the parking area with Danny. Danny said something and Matt shook his head, his expression tired and hurt.

Linda appeared beside him, touching his arm sympathetically. Matt gave her a wan smile.

Jealousy spiked through me, sharp and irrational. Linda had liked Matt last summer—everyone knew that. And now that I'd pushed him away, would she try again? Would Matt let her?

Did I have any right to care after what I'd done?

I packed up my equipment slowly, watching them walk away until they disappeared from view.

"You okay?" Captain Ed appeared beside me, his expression paternal and concerned.

"Fine, sir."

"You and Logan having problems?"

"No, sir. Just focusing on our training for the competition."

Captain Ed studied me with knowing eyes. "Josie, I've been running this crew for fifteen years. I know what focused training looks like, and I know what two people avoiding each other looks like. This is the latter."

"It's personal, Captain. Not work-related."

"Everything's work-related when it affects your performance. And watching you two today—technically perfect, emotionally dead—that affects performance." He paused. "Whatever you did, fix it. You're both miserable, and you're making the whole crew uncomfortable."

"Yes, sir."

But I didn't know how to fix it. I didn't even know if I wanted to fix it, or if fixing it meant facing fears I wasn't ready to confront.

That evening, I sat on the beach long after shift ended, watching the sunset alone. This spot—where Matt and I had talked after the rescue, where we'd first started really opening up to each other—now just felt empty.

Two weeks ago, I'd been convinced that independence was strength, that needing no one made me safe.

Then Matt had broken through my defenses, and for a brief, shining moment, I'd felt what it was like to be both strong and connected, both capable and loved.

And I'd thrown it away.

Because loving someone meant risking loss, and I'd decided I couldn't survive that risk.

But as I sat there watching the sun disappear below the horizon, the ocean vast and indifferent before me, I realized something:

I was already losing him. By pushing him away, I was creating the very loss I feared.

And it hurt just as much as I'd been afraid it would.

Maybe Betty was right. Maybe running from pain wasn't actually protecting me from anything. Maybe it was just ensuring I'd feel the pain of loneliness instead of the pain of potential loss.

But knowing that and being brave enough to fix it were two different things.

So I sat there until full dark, alone with my regrets and my fear, watching the place where Matt and I had almost been happy together.

And wondering if I'd just made the worst mistake of my life.
