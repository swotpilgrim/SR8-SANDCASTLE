# Chapter 26: Loving Means Strength

Walking back from the jetty with Matt's hand in mine felt like coming home.

The beach was nearly empty—families gone, lifeguard stands secured, just the two of us walking along the water's edge as the last light faded. Our fingers were laced together, his thumb tracing circles on my palm, and I couldn't stop smiling.

"You're grinning like an idiot," Matt observed, grinning himself.

"So are you."

We walked in comfortable silence, just enjoying being together without walls or fear. The ocean rolled in steadily. Marina Bay stretched peaceful around us.

"I talked to my mother about you," Matt said suddenly. "While I was in Philadelphia."

My heart skipped. "You did?"

"She asked why I looked so miserable helping with boat work. I told her about us. About how you ran away, how I didn't know if I could trust you again, how I was trying to decide whether to give you another chance."

"What did she say?"

"She said love requires courage from both people. That being vulnerable is scary, but building walls is lonelier. That if I loved you—and she could tell I did—I should figure out if you were worth the risk of getting hurt again."

"And?" I held my breath.

"And I decided you were. Are. You're worth the risk, Josie. Even knowing you might get scared again. Even knowing this isn't going to be easy." He squeezed my hand. "Because when we're good together, we're really good. And I'd rather have you scared and trying than not have you at all."

Tears pricked my eyes again. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."

"You waited for three years to stop being angry at me. That takes impressive stubbornness." He smiled. "Also you're an amazing lifeguard, you look great in a swimsuit, and you make me laugh even when I'm trying to be serious. Those are all compelling reasons."

I laughed and shoved him playfully. He pulled me closer, wrapping his arm around my shoulders as we walked.

"I'm scared," I admitted quietly. "Not of you. But of how much I need you. How much it would hurt if I lost you."

"I know. But Josie? That fear doesn't go away. Loving someone always means risking loss. Parents love their children knowing they might lose them. Soldiers' wives love their husbands knowing they might not come home. My mother loved my father knowing he might die young—and he probably will, with his heart condition. But she chose to love him anyway."

"How does she do it? How does she live with that fear?"

Matt was quiet for a moment, thinking. "I asked her once. She said the love is worth more than the fear. That having my father in her life, even with the risk, is better than protecting herself by being alone. That loving him makes her stronger, not weaker."

"I want to believe that."

"You already do, I think. You just needed time to figure it out." He stopped walking and turned to face me, hands on my shoulders. "You're one of the strongest people I know, Josie. You dive into dangerous water to save people. You train harder than anyone. You push yourself constantly to be better. That's strength."

"But I ran away from you. That's not strength."

"No, but coming back was. Admitting you were scared was. Telling me you loved me even though it terrified you was." His expression was serious and tender. "Vulnerability is a different kind of strength. It's not about being tough enough that nothing hurts you. It's about being brave enough to let things hurt you because they're worth it."

I thought about that—about the difference between my father's death and choosing to love Matt. One had been helpless loss. The other was conscious choice.

"My father's death taught me I couldn't control everything," I said slowly, working through the thought. "I was twelve and powerless and that felt unbearable. So I spent five years trying to never be powerless again. Being the strongest swimmer. The best lifeguard. Never needing anyone. Always in control."

"And then I came along and made you feel out of control."

"Yes. But—" I looked up at him. "Maybe control isn't the same as strength. Maybe real strength is being able to be vulnerable. To need someone. To love them even though you might lose them."

"I think so. My mother thinks so. And I think you're starting to think so too."

He was right. Standing there on the beach with my hand in his, I felt stronger than I had all summer. Not because I was independent and self-sufficient, but because I was brave enough to admit I needed him. Brave enough to let myself be vulnerable.

"I spent three years turning you into my enemy because that felt safer," I said. "Rivalry instead of attraction. Competition instead of connection. I convinced myself that beating you would prove I was good enough, strong enough, didn't need anyone."

"And then we won together. Co-champions."

"And it meant nothing because I'd lost what actually mattered." I squeezed his hands. "You tried to tell me. During the competition, when you talked about partnership making impossible choices possible. You understood what I was too scared to see."

"I had an advantage. I've watched my parents' partnership my whole life. They're not perfect—they argue, they disagree, my mother gets frustrated when my father won't rest like he should. But they're stronger together than either of them is alone. That's what I wanted us to have."

"Me too. I want that too." The words felt momentous and terrifying and right all at once. "I want to be partners with you, Matt. Not just at work. In everything."

His smile was bright enough to rival the stars starting to appear overhead. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. I want to figure out how to do this—how to love you without being paralyzed by fear. How to be strong enough to be vulnerable. How to trust that needing you doesn't make me weak."

"It doesn't. I promise it doesn't." He pulled me close, resting his forehead against mine. "And I'll help you remember that. Every time you get scared, every time that fear starts winning, I'll remind you that you're brave enough to do this. That we're brave enough together."

"What if I mess up again? What if I panic and push you away?"

"Then I'll be patient. I'll remind you of this conversation. I'll wait while you work through it." He kissed my forehead gently. "But Josie? I need you to promise you'll talk to me when you're scared. That you won't just run without giving me a chance to help."

"I promise. No more running. No more walls. Just honesty, even when it's hard."

"That's all I ask."

We stood there for a long moment, wrapped in each other's arms, listening to the ocean. I felt safe and scared and happy all at once—exactly how Betty had described real love. Not the absence of fear, but the choice to love despite it.

"My mother will want to meet you," I said suddenly. "She's been asking about you for weeks."

"I'd like that. My family too—they'll want to meet the girl who finally got through my defenses."

"You don't have defenses. You're the least defensive person I know."

"I do with you. Had to protect my heart somehow after you rejected me for three years." He was teasing, but I heard the truth underneath.

"I'm sorry. For all three years. For every cutting remark, every cold look, every time I treated you like an enemy instead of—" I paused. "Instead of the person I was falling for."

"You were falling for me even then?"

"Maybe. Probably. I was definitely attracted to you from the beginning, which is why your joke stung so much. If I hadn't cared what you thought, it wouldn't have hurt." I shook my head at my younger self. "I was an idiot."

"You were scared. There's a difference."

"You're very forgiving."

"I love you. Forgiveness comes with that." He kissed me again, sweet and lingering. "Besides, the rivalry made us both better lifeguards."

That was true. I wouldn't be the swimmer I was without Matt pushing me to improve. Wouldn't have trained as hard or developed such good technique.

We'd made each other better, even when we thought we were enemies.

"What happens after Labor Day?" I asked. "You're going to Rutgers for law school. I'm applying to physical education programs. We'll be—" I didn't want to say it.

"Apart," Matt finished. "I know. I've been thinking about that too."

"And?"

"And we'll figure it out. Write letters. Visit when we can. Make plans for breaks and holidays. It won't be easy, but—" He looked at me seriously. "Josie, I didn't wait three years for you just to give up because of distance. If you're willing to try, so am I."

"I'm willing. I'm absolutely willing." Relief flooded through me. "I was scared you'd say we should end things when summer ends."

"Not a chance. You're not getting rid of me that easily, Carter."

"Good. Because I plan to keep you around for a long time, Logan."

We walked back toward the boardwalk hand in hand, making plans for the remaining days of summer and the fall semester ahead. It wouldn't be easy—long distance never was. But we'd figure it out together.

Because that's what partners did.

When we reached the parking area, Matt's beat-up Ford was parked next to my mother's car. He pulled me close one more time.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For being brave enough to come to the marina last week. For being honest about your feelings. For giving us a chance despite being terrified." He kissed my forehead. "For finally letting me in."

"Thank you for waiting. For being patient. For forgiving me even though I didn't deserve it." I kissed him back. "For loving me even when I was too scared to love you back."

"Always," he said simply. "I'll always love you, Josie. Three years of competing, one summer of falling, and forever of choosing you."

I drove home with those words echoing in my heart, feeling lighter than I had in five years.

Forever of choosing you.

That's what love was, I realized. Not the absence of fear or the guarantee of safety. But the daily choice to be brave. To be vulnerable. To let someone in even knowing they might hurt you or leave you or die.

The choice to dive into dangerous water because saving something precious was worth the risk.

And Matt Logan was worth every risk I'd ever have to take.
