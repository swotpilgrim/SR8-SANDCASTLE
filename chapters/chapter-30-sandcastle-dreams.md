# Chapter 30: Sandcastle Dreams

Labor Day arrived with perfect end-of-summer weather—warm sun, gentle breeze, families crowding the beach for one last day before school started and routines returned and the carefree days of vacation became memory.

Matt and I worked our final shift of the season together, knowing this was the last time we'd sit on adjacent stands until next summer. Tomorrow he'd leave for Rutgers. In a week, I'd start my senior year of high school and begin applying to colleges with physical education programs.

Long distance was about to become our reality.

But sitting on stand three with Matt on stand four, working in perfect synchronization one more time, I felt ready. Scared, but ready.

"Swimmer drifting south," Matt called mid-morning.

"I see her. Approaching now."

We'd done this a hundred times this summer. Two hundred. The communication was effortless—words barely necessary because we understood each other's movements instinctively. Partnership in its purest form.

During lunch break, Captain Ed gathered the crew for the end-of-season speech.

"You've all done exceptional work this summer," he said, voice carrying authority and affection. "Thousands of swimmers kept safe. Multiple critical rescues performed flawlessly. A crew that worked together like family. I'm proud of every single one of you."

He paused, looking at Matt and me specifically.

"Carter and Logan, you two demonstrated something special this season. You showed us that partnership—real partnership built on trust and communication and mutual respect—is the foundation of everything we do. That team rescue at the competition will be talked about for years. But more than that, the way you work together every day, the way you've learned to trust each other, that's what makes this crew strong."

The crew applauded. Matt squeezed my hand.

"Next summer, some of you will return," Captain Ed continued. "Some of you are moving on to other things. But wherever you go, remember what you learned here. Remember that the best lifeguards aren't the strongest or the fastest—they're the ones who understand that we save more lives together than we ever could alone."

After the speech, Betty pulled me aside.

"So this is it. Last day of summer. Matt leaves tomorrow, you're stuck in high school for one more year, everything changes."

"I know. I'm trying not to think about it."

"Don't be scared. You two are going to be fine. You've figured out the hard part—letting each other in. Distance is just logistics."

"What if it's harder than I think? What if I panic when he's not here?"

"Then you write him a letter. You call him. You tell him you're scared instead of running away." Betty hugged me tight. "You've learned how to be brave, Josie. Don't forget that just because things get difficult."

"I won't. I promise."

Shift ended at four o'clock. The beach began to empty as families packed up their final picnics and folded their final blankets. Summer was ending—you could feel it in the air, in the way the light slanted differently, in the knowledge that tomorrow everything would change.

Matt climbed down from stand four and walked over to me.

"Want to do something before we have to say goodbye to summer?" he asked.

"What did you have in mind?"

He gestured toward the sand. "Build a sandcastle with me. One last time before everything changes."

I looked at him—this boy who'd waited three years, who'd taught me that vulnerability was strength, who'd forgiven my fear and loved me anyway—and felt my heart swell with affection and gratitude and hope.

"I'd love that."

We found a spot near the water's edge where the sand was perfect for building. A few families still dotted the beach, but mostly it was quiet—just us and the ocean and the fading summer day.

"I haven't built a sandcastle since I was a kid," I admitted, kneeling in the sand.

"Me neither. But I figure it's like anything else—easier together."

We started building—walls and towers, a moat around the perimeter, careful attention to structural integrity. Children from a nearby family wandered over to watch, then asked if they could help. Soon we had a whole crew of kids contributing ideas and sand.

"Make it taller!"

"Put a flag on top!"

"It needs a bridge!"

Matt laughed, patient with their enthusiasm, incorporating their suggestions. The sandcastle grew elaborate and slightly lopsided, more creative than technically sound, but beautiful in its imperfection.

"This sandcastle has better teamwork than we did our first three summers," Matt joked, smoothing a wall.

"Everything has better teamwork than we did our first three summers." I added shells to decorate a tower. "We were terrible partners back then. Too busy competing to cooperate."

"We were learning. Sometimes you have to figure out what doesn't work before you can figure out what does."

"Very wise, Logan."

"I have my moments."

When the sandcastle was finished—towers reaching for the sky, moat filled with seawater, shells and seaweed decorating every surface—we sat back to admire our work.

"It's beautiful," I said.

"It is. And it won't last. Tide will come in and wash it away in a few hours."

I thought about that—about building something beautiful knowing it was temporary. About investing time and care into something impermanent.

"That's okay," I said. "Some beautiful things are temporary. But that doesn't make them less meaningful."

"True. But what we've built together—" Matt took my hand. "That doesn't have to be temporary. That's what I want you to know, Josie. This summer changed everything for us. But what we've built—the partnership, the trust, the love—that comes with us when we leave. Distance doesn't wash that away."

Tears pricked my eyes. "Promise?"

"Promise. This isn't ending. It's just changing form. We'll write letters. Visit when we can. Talk on the phone. Make plans for holidays and breaks and next summer."

"Next summer feels very far away."

"It's nine months. We can do nine months." He squeezed my hand. "We waited three years to get here. Nine months is nothing."

He was right. We could do this.

The family who'd helped us build approached, camera in hand.

"Can we take your picture with the sandcastle?" the mother asked. "Our kids will want to remember this."

"Of course."

Matt and I posed beside our sandcastle creation, his arm around my shoulders, both of us smiling. The camera clicked. A moment captured forever—the last day of the summer that had changed everything.

After the family left, Matt and I stayed by the sandcastle, watching waves roll closer with each passing minute. The tide was coming in. Our beautiful creation would be gone soon.

"Tell me about next summer," I said. "When we're both back here. What will that look like?"

Matt was quiet for a moment, thinking. "You'll be starting college. Maybe at Rutgers if you get in—we could be at the same school. Maybe somewhere else, but close. Either way, we'll both be here for summer season."

"Adjacent stands again?"

"Adjacent stands. Perfect partnership. And this time we won't waste three years competing." He smiled. "We'll just be together from day one."

"That sounds perfect."

"Yeah?" He turned to face me fully. "Josie, I need you to know something. This summer—meeting you, falling for you, finally having you love me back—this has been the best summer of my life. And I know next year will be hard sometimes. Distance is hard. Being apart is hard. But I'll wait for you. However long it takes, I'll wait."

"You've already waited three years."

"And I'd wait three more if I had to. Ten more. Twenty more. You're worth waiting for, Josie Carter. You always have been."

I kissed him, tasting salt water and summer and promise. Around us, the beach continued emptying. The sun sank lower toward the horizon. Waves crept closer to our sandcastle.

When we pulled apart, I said the words I'd been too scared to say for so long.

"I love you, Matt Logan. I'll love you next week when you're at Rutgers. I'll love you in January when winter feels endless. I'll love you next summer when we're back here together. I'll love you through distance and difficulty and fear. Because you taught me that love is worth the risk. That partnership is worth the vulnerability. That choosing someone over and over is what real courage looks like."

"I love you too. Have for three years. Will for the rest of my life."

A wave reached the sandcastle, washing against its base. Then another. Slowly, inevitably, the structure we'd built began to dissolve—towers softening, walls collapsing, the beautiful temporary thing returning to sand and water.

"It's washing away," I said, watching.

"Sandcastles always do. That's part of their beauty. They exist perfectly for a moment, then they're gone." Matt stood, pulling me up with him. "But we're not sandcastles. What we've built is permanent. The partnership, the trust, the love—that stays."

He was right.

The sandcastle would be gone by morning, smoothed away by tide and time. But what Matt and I had created this summer—the understanding, the forgiveness, the brave choice to love despite fear—that would remain. Distance might separate us temporarily, but the foundation we'd built was solid.

We'd made each other better. Stronger. Braver.

And that would last far longer than any structure built from sand.

We walked back toward the lifeguard station hand in hand as the sun set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and pinks. The beach was nearly empty now. Our sandcastle was half-dissolved, soon to be completely gone. Summer was ending.

But we were just beginning.

"See you next summer?" Matt asked, even though we'd see each other long before then. It was tradition—the way guards always said goodbye at season's end.

"See you next summer," I confirmed. "Same beach. Same stands. Same partnership."

"Better partnership. Because we won't be wasting time pretending we're enemies when we both know we're in love."

"Much better partnership."

He kissed me one more time as the sun dipped below the horizon—sweet and lingering and full of promise for all the summers to come.

Tomorrow would bring goodbyes and distance and the challenge of loving each other from far away. But tonight, we had this moment. This beach. This summer that had taught me everything about courage and vulnerability and the strength it takes to let someone in.

The sandcastle was gone, washed smooth by waves and tide.

But our dreams—our sandcastle dreams of partnership and love and summers spent side by side—those were just beginning.

And I was finally brave enough to reach for them.
