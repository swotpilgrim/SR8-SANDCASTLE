# Chapter 7: Dangerous Conditions

Saturday arrived with deceptive beauty—cloudless sky, warm sun, perfect beach weather. But I saw the warning signs the moment I reached the shore.

The ocean was wrong.

Not obviously dangerous. The waves looked normal, rolling in with steady rhythm. But the pattern was off—the way the surf broke, the color of the water further out, the foam distribution along the tideline. Three years of lifeguarding had taught me to read the ocean like a language, and today it was speaking danger.

Captain Ed stood at the station studying the water with the same concerned expression I felt.

"Riptide," he said as I approached.

"From last night's storm?"

"Storm pulled out a lot of sand, changed the underwater topography. We've got strong current running parallel about fifty yards out, pulling everything south." He pointed to where I could just see the telltale signs—the gap in the breaking waves, the subtle difference in water color, the way debris moved in unusual patterns.

"Flag system?"

"Red flags every twenty feet, double guards on all stands, shortened swimming boundaries." Captain Ed pulled out his whistle. "And I want everyone extra sharp today. No assumptions, no distractions. This is the kind of day people get in trouble."

The crew meeting was tense. Captain Ed explained the riptide conditions in detail, demonstrated the current patterns with diagrams, reminded us of rescue protocols for swimmers caught in strong current.

"If someone gets pulled out, you do NOT swim straight at them," he emphasized. "You'll just get caught in the same current. Angle your approach, swim parallel first, then come in from the side. And if you need backup, you call for it. No heroics."

Matt and I were assigned to adjacent stands again—stands three and four, the busiest swimming section. Captain Ed wanted his most experienced guards on the highest-risk area.

"You two work together today," he said pointedly. "Watch each other's zones, back each other up. This is about safety, not competition. Understood?"

"Yes, sir," we answered in unison.

I climbed to stand three and immediately began my scan pattern. The beach was already filling—Saturday in late July meant crowds. Families claimed spots under umbrellas, children ran toward the water with inflatable toys, teenagers clustered in groups showing off for each other. So many people, and most of them had no idea the ocean was dangerous today.

"Carter."

Matt's voice from stand four. I looked over to find him watching me with unusual seriousness.

"We need to coordinate," he said. "Split the zone into sectors, make sure we're not both watching the same areas."

He was right. Professional and smart. I nodded. "I'll take north section primary, south section secondary. You take south primary, north secondary?"

"Works for me. And if either of us goes in for a rescue—"

"The other covers both zones until backup arrives."

"Right." Matt held my gaze. "Today's not about competing, Carter. Today's about keeping people safe."

"I know that, Logan."

"Good." He turned back to his water, and I did the same.

The morning was relentless.

By nine a.m., I'd made two rescues—both teenagers who'd ignored the flags and gotten caught in the current's edge. The first was a boy showing off for his friends, swimming out farther than he should have, realizing too late that he couldn't swim back against the pull. The second was a girl on an inflatable raft, not understanding that the current didn't care about her flotation device. They weren't in serious danger yet when I reached them, but another few minutes and they would have been. I brought them back one at a time, delivered the mandatory safety lecture about respecting the flags and the ocean's power, and returned to my stand with lungs burning and adrenaline humming.

Matt made three rescues by ten a.m. I watched him work between my own scans—efficient, calm, professional. He talked to each victim as he brought them in, keeping them calm, explaining what he was doing. He never looked rattled, never rushed, just executed perfect technique and brought people back to safety. The third rescue was a man who'd been fighting the current so hard he was nearly exhausted when Matt reached him. I watched Matt handle it with textbook precision, approaching from the right angle, securing the victim properly, swimming parallel to shore to escape the current before heading in. Perfect execution.

We were a good team, even separated by fifteen feet of sand. I hated to admit it, but it was true.

"Swimmer beyond flags, north section!" Matt called.

I was already moving, whistle blaring. A middle-aged man had ventured past the safe zone, trying to retrieve his son's beach ball. I signaled him back with sharp hand gestures. He waved acknowledgment and started swimming toward shore.

Then the current caught him.

I saw it happen—the moment his expression changed from annoyed to concerned to frightened. His stroke pattern became frantic. He was fighting the current instead of working with it, exhausting himself.

"I've got him!" I shouted to Matt and dove in.

The water was rougher than it looked from shore. The current pulled at me immediately, trying to drag me south. I angled my approach like Captain Ed had drilled into us, swimming parallel to shore first, then cutting in from the side.

The man was panicking now, thrashing in the water. Panicking victims were the most dangerous—they could pull you under in their terror.

"Sir! Stop fighting!" I called as I approached. "I'm a lifeguard! Let me help you!"

He grabbed for me desperately. I evaded his grasp and got him in a cross-chest carry, securing him from behind where he couldn't pull me down.

"Relax," I said firmly. "I've got you. Stop fighting the water."

He was heavy and strong and terrified. Swimming him back against the current took all my strength. My shoulders screamed. My lungs burned. But I kept pulling, kept kicking, kept moving toward shore.

Matt appeared beside me in the water.

"Need help?" he asked, swimming alongside.

"I'm fine," I gasped.

"Take it anyway."

He positioned himself on the opposite side, and together we brought the man in. With two of us, it was manageable instead of brutal. We reached the shallows and got the victim to his feet. He stumbled onto the beach, coughing and shaking but safe.

"Thank you," he gasped. "Thank you. I thought—"

"You're safe now," I said. "But stay out of the water today. Those currents are dangerous."

Captain Ed appeared with the first aid kit, checking the man over. Matt and I stood aside, catching our breath.

"Thanks for the backup," I said quietly.

"That's what we're here for." Matt scanned the water, already back in vigilance mode. "We should get back to the stands. Crowd's getting bigger."

He was right. The beach was packed now—easily two hundred people, maybe more. Children everywhere, parents distracted, teenagers taking risks. My stomach knotted with anxiety.

This was the kind of day accidents happened.

We climbed back to our stands. I logged the rescue in my book—victim description, time, location, condition—and updated my count. Seven rescues today already, and it wasn't even noon. I returned to scanning, eyes moving in the practiced pattern Captain Ed had drilled into us: near zone, middle zone, far zone, repeat. Never stop scanning, never assume everything's fine, never let your attention wander.

Two swimmers in the moderate zone, staying in bounds. Family with young children in the shallows, mother watching them carefully. Teenage boy on a float, drifting toward the boundary. His friends were on the beach, not paying attention to how far he was moving.

"South section, watch the float!" I called to Matt.

"On it!"

His whistle cut sharp across the beach. The boy on the float looked up, startled. Matt gestured him back toward shore with the hand signals we all knew. The kid waved acknowledgment and paddled back toward shallow water, rejoining his friends.

We fell into rhythm—scanning, calling out potential problems, coordinating our responses. "Three swimmers far north," I'd say, and Matt would confirm "I see them." "Raft drifting south," he'd call, and I'd whistle them back. We were speaking in the shorthand developed over three years of working adjacent stands, knowing each other's rhythms and patterns without conscious thought. For once, our competitive awareness translated into perfect teamwork instead of rivalry.

Noon brought shift change, but Captain Ed kept the morning crew on overtime. "Too crowded, too dangerous. Everyone stays until the beach clears or conditions improve."

The afternoon got worse.

More people arrived. More families, more children, more swimmers who didn't understand the danger. I made four more rescues. Matt made five. We were both exhausted, running on adrenaline and professional determination.

Around two p.m., I spotted him.

A child—maybe seven years old, small for his age—playing at the water's edge. His mother was twenty feet away, spreading out a picnic blanket, not watching. The child ventured deeper, drawn by shells visible in the clear water. Deeper, then deeper still, until waves were hitting his chest.

"Kid in the shallows, south section!" I called to Matt.

"I see him! Signaling the mother!"

But before Matt could get her attention, a large wave hit the child. He went under, came up sputtering, and the current grabbed him.

In seconds—literally seconds—he was beyond the swimming boundary, being pulled rapidly out to sea.

I blew my emergency whistle, the pattern for critical rescue.

"Child in riptide!" I screamed. "Far south section, moving fast!"

Matt was already diving from his stand.

So was I.

This was bad. Really bad. A small child, already far out, being pulled by strong current into deep water. No time to wait for backup. No time for careful planning.

We hit the water at a dead run and swam harder than I'd ever swum in my life, racing against the current that was dragging that child farther and farther from shore.

Behind us, I heard Captain Ed's whistle calling for backup.

Ahead of us, the child went under.

We swam.
