# Chapter 1: First Day Back

The boardwalk was still wet with morning dew when I walked toward Marina Bay Beach, my canvas bag slung over my shoulder and my red lifeguard swimsuit already on beneath my cotton sundress. June mornings in New Jersey smell like salt and possibility—the ocean breathing in and out, the wooden planks of the boardwalk warm under my bare feet, the promise of summer stretching ahead like an endless horizon.

This was my third summer as a lifeguard. I was seventeen now, not the nervous fifteen-year-old who'd shown up that first summer with something to prove.

The beach emerged before me as I crested the last rise of the boardwalk—wide and golden, striped umbrellas still furled, lifeguard stands like white sentinels with their red crosses painted bright against the morning sky. My stand. My beach. My summer.

Captain Ed Morrison was already at the station, his Navy bearing unmistakable even in civilian clothes. At forty-five, he ran the Marina Bay lifeguard crew with military precision softened by genuine care. He looked up from his clipboard as I approached.

"Carter. Good to have you back."

"Good to be back, Captain."

His handshake was firm, approving. "You've been training?"

"Every day, sir."

"Good. We're going to need everyone sharp this summer." He glanced at his watch. "Crew meeting in ten. Grab your stand before the new recruits stake claims."

I didn't need to be told twice. I walked across the sand—still cool from the night, unmarked by footprints—to the lifeguard stand overlooking the main swimming area. Stand number three. The best vantage point on the beach, the busiest section, the place where the real lifeguarding happened. I'd earned this spot two summers ago and defended it since.

Climbing the ladder, I surveyed my domain. The ocean rolled in steady and calm this morning, deceptively peaceful. I knew better. The Atlantic could turn in an instant. That's why we were here.

I checked the equipment methodically: rescue buoy, first aid kit, whistle, binoculars, log book. Everything where it should be. I ran my hand along the wooden rail, feeling the grain smooth under my palm. Ready.

The crew gathered for Captain Ed's meeting—a mix of returning guards and new faces. I counted fourteen total. The returning guards greeted each other with handshakes and back slaps, comparing tans and trading stories from the off-season. I hung back slightly, observing.

Linda Hayes waved at me from across the group—the only other female lifeguard, back for her second summer. I waved back politely but didn't move closer. I didn't need allies. I needed to be the best.

"All right, listen up!" Captain Ed's voice cut through the chatter. We assembled in a loose semicircle around him, and I found myself standing next to Danny Sullivan, a returning guard with an easy grin and natural friendliness that made him everyone's buddy.

"Welcome back to those returning, and welcome aboard to our new recruits," Captain Ed said. "This is the Marina Bay Beach Patrol. We run the best lifeguard operation on the Jersey shore, and we're keeping it that way."

He launched into the safety briefing—protocols, whistle signals, flag systems, rescue techniques, emergency procedures. I'd heard it before, but I listened anyway. Complacency killed.

"Schedules are posted," he continued. "Morning shift runs six to two, afternoon two to eight. You'll rotate stands to stay fresh. Questions?"

One of the new guards, a tall boy with sunburned shoulders and obvious nerves, raised his hand. "Sir, is it true we have to do weekly rescue drills?"

"Weekly minimum," Captain Ed confirmed. "Sometimes daily if I think you need it. Anyone else?"

Another new guard—this one with the cocky slouch of someone who thought he already knew everything—spoke without raising his hand. "What's the deal with having girl lifeguards? Seems like the rescues might be too physical for—"

"Can it, Brennan." Danny's voice was sharp, his usual friendliness gone. Several returning guards shifted uncomfortably.

My jaw tightened, but I kept my expression neutral. This wasn't new.

Captain Ed's stare could have frozen the ocean. "Let me make something crystal clear for the new recruits. I don't care if you're male or female, tall or short, local or from out of town. I care if you can swim, if you can rescue, and if you can follow orders. Carter here—" he nodded at me "—pulled three successful rescues last summer, including a double in rough surf. Hayes made five. They've both passed the same qualifications you did, probably faster. If you have a problem with that, there's the door."

Silence. Brennan looked at his feet.

"We're a team here," Captain Ed continued, his tone returning to normal. "You watch each other's backs, you support each other, and you leave your egos in your lockers. Understood?"

A chorus of "Yes, sir" rippled through the group.

"Good. Dismissed. Be on your stands in twenty."

The meeting broke up. I headed back toward stand three, ignoring the curious looks from the new guards. Danny caught up with me.

"Don't mind Brennan," he said. "Kid's an idiot. He'll wash out by July."

"I don't mind him," I said truthfully. "I've heard worse."

"Yeah, well, you shouldn't have to." Danny grinned. "Besides, you're faster than half these guys on a bad day. They'll figure it out."

I climbed my stand and settled in, pulling out the log book to record the morning conditions: clear skies, calm surf, light winds from the northeast. Perfect opening day weather.

Around noon, Betty appeared at the base of my stand. Betty Kowalski had been my best friend since grade school—warm, romantic, and the complete opposite of my guarded nature. She wore her ice cream parlor uniform, pink and white stripes with a matching cap.

"Lunch break!" she called up.

I climbed down and we sat in the shade. She handed me a tuna sandwich wrapped in wax paper.

"So? How's it feel to be back?"

"Good. Really good."

"Meet any cute new guards?"

I rolled my eyes. "Betty."

"What? You're seventeen, Josie. You're allowed to notice boys."

"I'm here to work, not flirt."

"Summer romance is basically mandatory," Betty said. "How is Tommy?"

Her face lit up—she'd been dating Tommy Chen since last summer. "Wonderful. We're going to the dance at the pavilion next Saturday. You should come."

"Maybe."

"That means no."

"That means maybe." I finished my sandwich and brushed crumbs off my swimsuit. "I'm focused on the competition this year, Bets. That's my summer goal. Win the trophy, prove I'm the best lifeguard on this crew."

Betty sighed dramatically. "You're already one of the best. Everyone knows it."

"Second best doesn't count."

"You're so competitive." But she said it fondly, like it was an endearing flaw rather than a character defect.

We talked for a few more minutes before Betty had to get back to the ice cream parlor. The afternoon shift was quiet—a Monday in early June, before the real crowds arrived. A handful of families dotted the beach, children building sandcastles, mothers reading under umbrellas. I scanned the water every few seconds, automatic and constant. Two swimmers in the moderate zone, staying well within boundaries. A couple wading in the shallows. No flags, no whistles needed.

Around three o'clock, Captain Ed walked the beach, stopping at each stand for a quick check-in. When he reached mine, he climbed halfway up the ladder.

"How're we looking, Carter?"

"All clear, sir. Light crowd, calm conditions."

"Good." He glanced at his clipboard. "I'm finalizing the schedule for the week. You'll be on stand three through Wednesday, then I'm rotating you to five for Thursday and Friday."

"Yes, sir."

He hesitated, then added, "Matt Logan arrives tomorrow. He'll be on stand four."

Everything in me went still and tight.

Stand four was adjacent to stand three. Fifteen feet of sand between platforms. Close enough to see every movement, hear every conversation, feel every moment of his presence like static electricity before a storm.

"Understood," I said, keeping my voice level.

Captain Ed studied my face. "You two going to be able to work together professionally this summer?"

"Of course, sir."

"Good. Because you're my two best guards, and I need both of you focused on the water, not on whatever rivalry you've got going."

"It won't be a problem," I lied.

He nodded, apparently satisfied, and continued down the beach. I gripped the wooden rail of my stand, knuckles white.

Matt Logan.

Three years of competition. Three years of traded barbs and one-upsmanship and constant, exhausting vigilance. Three years of him getting under my skin like sand in a swimsuit—impossible to ignore, impossible to shake off.

He was coming back tomorrow, and my perfect summer suddenly felt a lot more complicated.

When Betty stopped by after her shift ended, she took one look at my face and frowned.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing."

"Josie."

I sighed. "Matt Logan comes back tomorrow."

Betty's eyes widened. "Oh. That Matt."

"Yes, that Matt."

"The one you've been competing with for three years?"

"The same."

"The one you definitely don't have feelings for?"

"I don't have feelings for him, Betty. I have feelings about him. Specifically, annoyance."

Betty settled onto the sand. "You know, most people don't spend three years obsessing over someone they're just annoyed by."

"I'm not obsessing. I'm maintaining appropriate competitive awareness."

"And the fact that you get all tense hearing his name?"

"He's arrogant and condescending."

"If you say so." Betty's smile was knowing.

I climbed down from the stand. "Matt Logan is my rival. He's the obstacle between me and winning the competition. That's all."

Betty stood, brushing sand from her skirt. "Okay, Josie. Whatever you say."

But as I walked home that evening, my canvas bag bumping against my hip, I couldn't shake the knot of tension in my stomach. Matt Logan was coming back tomorrow, and three years of rivalry had taught me one undeniable truth: he had the power to throw me completely off balance.

I just had to make sure he didn't know it.

The boarding house was quiet when I arrived. I found my mother in the kitchen, washing dishes.

"How was your first day back?" she asked.

"Good. Quiet."

She smiled. "You look happy."

I was happy. Or I had been, until Captain Ed mentioned Matt's return.

Tomorrow would come soon enough. And with it, Matt Logan, and all the complications he brought.

I told myself I was ready for it.

I told myself it would be fine.

I told myself a lot of things that night, lying in bed listening to the distant sound of waves, that I wasn't entirely sure I believed.
