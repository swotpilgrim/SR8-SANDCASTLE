# Chapter 6: Training Montage

The next two weeks consumed me.

I woke before dawn every morning and ran the length of Marina Bay Beach—three miles out, three miles back—pushing my pace until my lungs burned and my legs trembled. The ocean was dark and mysterious in those pre-sunrise hours, the boardwalk empty except for the occasional fisherman heading to the pier.

I wasn't alone.

The first morning I spotted him, I thought it was coincidence. Matt Logan jogging the opposite direction, hair wind-tousled, breathing steady. We passed each other with curt nods, neither slowing.

The second morning, same thing.

By the third morning, it was clearly intentional. We'd both claimed these early hours for training, and neither was willing to cede the territory.

Sometimes we ran the same direction, maintaining careful distance—never together, but never truly apart either. I'd hear his footfalls behind me and push harder. He'd see me ahead and increase his pace. We turned training into competition without ever speaking about it.

Betty noticed the exhaustion at lunch one day.

"You look dead on your feet," she observed, handing me a sandwich.

"I'm fine."

"You're training too hard."

"The competition is in seven weeks."

"And you'll be useless if you burn yourself out before then." Betty studied me with knowing eyes. "Does Matt train this early too?"

I didn't answer, which was answer enough.

"Josie."

"What? We're both serious about winning. There's nothing wrong with rigorous preparation."

"There's rigorous preparation, and then there's whatever this is." Betty gestured at me. "You're obsessed. And I'm pretty sure he is too, which makes me think this isn't actually about the trophy."

"Then what's it about?"

"You tell me."

I couldn't. Or wouldn't. The truth was too complicated—tangled up in pride and competition and something else I refused to examine.

After the morning runs came the swimming drills. I practiced everything: sprint intervals to build explosive speed, distance endurance to outlast anyone in the water, underwater swimming to strengthen my lungs, surface rescues with every variation of victim behavior. I commandeered my assigned lifeguard stand during off-hours and ran myself through scenarios until my technique was absolutely flawless—no wasted motion, no hesitation, nothing that could cost me even a fraction of a second.

Matt did the same. On his stand, fifteen feet away.

We didn't train together, but we trained in parallel—always aware of each other, always measuring our progress against the other's. If I swam to the jetty and back, timing myself, he did too, timing himself. If he practiced rescue carries with Danny, trying different holds and approaches, I practiced with Betty, matching every variation. We were locked in this strange dance of competitive proximity, neither leading nor following, but moving in perfect synchronization.

The crew watched our obsessive competition with equal parts amusement and concern.

"You two are going to kill yourselves," Danny said one afternoon, watching Matt finish a brutal interval set.

"Just training," Matt replied, breathing hard.

"There's training and there's whatever self-destructive thing you're doing." Danny glanced at my stand, where I was reviewing first aid protocols. "And she's just as bad. You're feeding off each other's intensity."

"Is that wrong?"

"It's not wrong, it's just... intense. Makes the rest of us wonder what you're really competing for."

Matt didn't answer, and Danny didn't push.

The proximity created awareness I couldn't escape. I noticed things I didn't want to notice.

The way Matt's shoulders moved when he swam—powerful strokes, efficient technique, pure athletic grace that made swimming look effortless even when I knew from my own exhaustion exactly how hard he was working.

The sound of his voice when he helped train the new guards—patient, encouraging, genuinely kind. He never made them feel stupid for asking questions, never showed the impatience I sometimes felt when explaining basic techniques for the third time.

How he always checked the beach one more time before leaving his stand, scanning for any last potential danger, taking his responsibility seriously. He cared about keeping people safe, not just about being the best. Sometimes I wondered if I'd lost sight of that difference.

The rare full smile he gave when something genuinely amused him, different from his usual competitive smirk—open and warm and briefly unguarded. It transformed his whole face, made him look younger and more approachable and dangerously appealing.

These observations felt dangerous. They softened the edges of my rivalry, complicated the simple narrative of competition. I didn't want to notice Matt Logan as anything other than my opponent.

But I did notice. And noticing made everything harder. Made him harder to hate, harder to reduce to just an obstacle between me and victory.

One morning during the second week, we both arrived at the jetty at the same time after our runs. The sun was just cresting the horizon, painting everything gold and pink. We stood on the rocks, catching our breath, not quite looking at each other.

"This is getting ridiculous," Matt said finally.

"What is?"

"This." He gestured between us. "We're training at the exact same times, running the exact same routes. It's like we're competing over who can train harder."

"Isn't that the point of training?"

"Training is about improving yourself, not destroying yourself to prove something to someone else."

I bristled. "I'm not trying to prove anything to you."

"Aren't you?" He turned to face me directly. "Because from where I'm standing, we're both obsessed with beating each other. And I can't figure out if it's about the trophy or about... something else."

My heart pounded, and it wasn't just from the run. "What else would it be about?"

Matt held my gaze for a long moment, and I saw uncertainty in his eyes—like he was trying to solve a puzzle he didn't have all the pieces to.

"I don't know," he admitted. "But this doesn't feel like normal competition anymore."

Before I could respond—before I had to respond—he jogged off back toward the beach, leaving me alone on the jetty with the sunrise and too many thoughts I didn't want to think.

The training continued relentlessly.

Danny convinced Matt to practice paired rescues, which required a partner. I watched from my stand as they ran through scenarios—one playing victim, one rescuing, coordinating their movements. They looked good together, smooth and efficient.

I felt an uncomfortable twist in my chest that might have been envy. Not of Danny—of their easy partnership, their ability to work together without all the complicated history weighing things down.

That afternoon, Betty agreed to practice paired rescues with me. We waded into the water and ran through the drill: Betty played an unconscious victim, I approached and secured her, we swam back to shore together.

It was fine. Competent. Professional.

It wasn't what Matt and Danny had looked like.

"You're distracted," Betty said after our third run-through.

"I'm fine."

"You're watching stand four instead of focusing on the rescue."

I had been watching. Watching Matt work with Danny, watching their coordinated movements, comparing our partnership to theirs and finding ours wanting.

"I just want to make sure we're as good as them," I said.

"This isn't a competition, Josie. We're practicing teamwork."

"Everything's a competition when it comes to Matt Logan."

Betty sighed. "Maybe that's the problem."

By the end of the second week, my body was exhausted but stronger. My swim times had improved by measurable increments. My rescue techniques were sharper than ever. I was in the best physical condition of my life.

And I was miserable.

The constant competition, the relentless awareness of Matt, the way every accomplishment felt empty unless it involved beating him—it was wearing me down emotionally even as it built me up physically.

Late one evening, I found my mother on the front porch of the boarding house, enjoying the ocean breeze. I sat beside her, too tired to pretend I wasn't exhausted.

"How's training?" she asked gently.

"Hard."

"You're pushing yourself very hard."

"I want to win."

"I know you do, sweetheart." She paused. "But I worry you're losing sight of why you became a lifeguard in the first place."

I looked at her, surprised. "What do you mean?"

"You told me once that lifeguarding made you feel strong and capable after your father died. That saving people mattered to you. That being in the water brought you peace." Her eyes were sad. "Does it still bring you peace? Or has it become all about beating Matt Logan?"

The question hit harder than I expected. When had I last felt peaceful in the water? When had I last enjoyed swimming for its own sake, rather than as training for competition?

"I don't know," I admitted.

"Maybe that's something to think about." My mother squeezed my hand. "Wanting to be the best is admirable. But not if it costs you joy in the thing you love."

That night, I lay awake thinking about what she'd said. About why I loved lifeguarding, why I loved swimming, what I was really chasing with all this obsessive training.

And about Matt Logan, who had somehow become both my greatest competitor and the standard by which I measured every achievement. When had beating him become more important than anything else? And what did that say about me?

I didn't have answers. But lying there in the dark, I felt something shift—a tiny crack in the armor I'd built around myself, letting in the uncomfortable possibility that my mother and Betty were both right.

This wasn't really about the trophy.

It was about Matt.

And I had no idea what to do with that realization.
