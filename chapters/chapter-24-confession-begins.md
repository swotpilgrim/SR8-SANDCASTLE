# Chapter 24: Confession Begins

The week after Matt left felt like the longest of my life.

I worked my shifts with mechanical efficiency—scanning water, blowing my whistle, logging observations. But everything felt different without Matt. Stand four sat empty. The space where he should have been felt like a missing tooth.

Betty noticed immediately.

"You look miserable," she said on Monday, sitting beside me during lunch break. "Matt's only been gone one day."

"Six more to go."

"You really meant it, didn't you? What you told him at the marina?"

"Every word." I stared out at the ocean, watching families enjoy the late August sunshine. "I've spent the past week thinking about what he said. About how I dive into dangerous water every day to save people, but I won't risk my heart. He was right, Betty. I've been a coward."

"Not a coward. Just scared. There's a difference."

"Is there? Because I pushed away the best thing that ever happened to me because I was too afraid to be vulnerable. That feels like cowardice to me."

Betty squeezed my hand. "But you're not being a coward now. You told him you love him. You're waiting for him to come back. You're choosing courage instead of running away. That counts for something."

I hoped she was right.

Tuesday brought more of the same—work, empty stand, hollow feeling where Matt should be. Captain Ed pulled me aside after shift.

"You doing okay, Carter?"

"Yes, sir. Just focused on the job."

"You're doing fine work. But you seem distracted." He paused. "Matt's coming back before Labor Day, you know. You'll have a chance to talk to him again."

"I know. I'm trying to be patient."

"Patience is good. But so is action." Captain Ed's expression was kind but firm. "When he gets back, don't waste time second-guessing yourself. Tell him how you feel. Show him you meant what you said. Life's too short for regrets, Josie."

"Yes, sir."

Wednesday afternoon, Betty found me after my shift ended. "Want to help at the ice cream shop? My mother's short-staffed and I could use the company. Plus sitting alone in your boarding house room thinking about Matt isn't helping anyone."

She was right. I spent the evening scooping ice cream and cleaning tables, grateful for the distraction. But every time a couple came in holding hands, or a family ordered sundaes to share, I thought about Matt and that night we'd shared a sundae together.

The night before everything fell apart.

The night I should have been brave instead of scared.

Thursday morning brought a postcard in the mail. My mother handed it to me at breakfast with a knowing smile.

The front showed the Philadelphia waterfront. I flipped it over with shaking hands.

*Josie—*

*Philadelphia is great but I miss the ocean. Miss Marina Bay. The boat delivery went smoothly. Uncle says I'm getting better at navigation but still need work on knot-tying. (He's wrong—my knots are fine.)*

*Been thinking a lot. About what you said at the marina. About what I said. About us.*

*See you Monday.*

*— M*

I read it three times, looking for hidden meaning in every word. "Been thinking a lot" could mean anything. Was he thinking about forgiving me? Or thinking about how he couldn't trust me again?

"He sent you a postcard," my mother observed. "That's a good sign."

"Or it's just him being polite."

"Matt Logan doesn't strike me as someone who does things out of politeness. If he sent you a postcard, it's because he wanted to." She refilled my coffee cup. "Have faith, sweetheart. You told him the truth. You were vulnerable and honest. Now you have to trust that it was enough."

But what if it wasn't enough? What if I'd hurt him too many times, pushed him away too often, and he'd decided during his week away that he was better off without me?

Friday dragged endlessly. The beach was crowded with families making the most of the last weekend before Labor Day. I worked with Linda on adjacent stands. She was professional and competent, but the easy partnership I'd had with Matt was gone.

"You miss him," Linda said during a quiet moment.

I didn't bother denying it. "Yes."

"He misses you too, you know. Before he left, Danny said Matt was miserable. As miserable as you've been."

"That doesn't make me feel better. I don't want him to be miserable. I want him to be happy."

"Maybe he'll be happy when he gets back and you two finally stop dancing around your feelings and just be together." Linda smiled. "You're good together, Josie. Everyone could see it during that team rescue. The way you moved like one person, trusted each other completely—that's rare. Don't give up on it."

"I'm trying not to."

Saturday morning, I woke early and walked to the beach before my shift started. The sand was cool under my bare feet, the ocean calm and beautiful in the dawn light. I stood at the water's edge and thought about everything that had happened this summer.

I'd started June focused entirely on the competition. Determined to prove I was the best lifeguard on the beach. Convinced that winning would validate me somehow, make me feel strong and capable and enough.

And I had won—co-champion, tied with Matt, exactly what I'd wanted.

But the trophy sat on my dresser collecting dust, and I barely looked at it anymore.

Because Matt had been right about something else too: victory meant nothing without partnership. Being the best meant nothing if I was too broken to let myself be loved.

I'd spent three years competing with him, weeks falling for him, and one terrible night pushing him away.

Now I had one more day until he came back.

One more day to prepare myself for whatever he'd decided during his week away.

One more day before I'd know if I'd waited too long to be brave.

Sunday evening, Betty came to my boarding house room and sat on my bed while I tried on and rejected outfit after outfit.

"He's coming back tomorrow," I said, holding up a blue dress and frowning at it. "I need to look—I don't know. Like myself. Like someone worth waiting for."

"You are worth waiting for. And you always look like yourself." Betty pulled the dress from my hands. "Stop obsessing about clothes. He's not coming back to see your wardrobe. He's coming back to see if you meant what you said."

"What if I can't convince him? What if he's decided I'm too much work, too damaged, too scared?"

"Then you'll survive," Betty said gently. "It will hurt like hell, but you'll survive. But Josie? I don't think that's going to happen. I think Matt Logan has been in love with you for three years, and one week away isn't going to change that. I think he's coming back ready to forgive you if you show him you're serious."

"How do I show him I'm serious?"

"By being honest. By being vulnerable. By telling him exactly how you feel without holding anything back." She squeezed my hand. "By being the girl who dives into dangerous water without hesitation. Be that brave with your heart."

That night I lay in bed unable to sleep, staring at the ceiling and rehearsing what I'd say to Matt when I saw him.

*I love you. I meant everything I said at the marina. I'm not scared anymore. Actually, I'm terrified, but I'm choosing you anyway. I'm choosing us. Please give me another chance.*

The words sounded good in my head. I just hoped they'd sound good out loud.

Hoped Matt would believe them.

Hoped seven days had been enough time for him to decide I was worth the risk.

Monday morning arrived with perfect late-summer weather—warm sun, cool breeze, ocean sparkling like something from a postcard. The beach would be packed on this last official day before Labor Day, families making the most of their final vacation hours.

I dressed carefully in my lifeguard uniform, nothing fancy, just myself. Pulled my hair back in a ponytail. Looked at my reflection and tried to see what Matt saw—the girl who'd been too scared to let him in, or the girl who was finally brave enough to try.

My mother caught me before I left for the beach.

"Whatever happens today, I'm proud of you," she said. "Your father would be proud too. Not because you won that competition, but because you're finally learning that loving people is the bravest thing we do."

"What if he doesn't want me anymore?"

"Then you'll know you tried. You'll know you were honest and vulnerable and brave. And someday—maybe not soon, but someday—that will matter more than whether he forgave you or not." She hugged me tight. "But I think he'll forgive you. Because people don't wait three years for someone unless they really love them."

I walked to the beach with my heart hammering, scanning the crowd for any sign of Matt. Captain Ed was setting up for the day. Danny was organizing equipment. Linda was already climbing to her stand.

But no Matt.

Maybe he wasn't coming until later. Maybe the boat work had taken longer than expected. Maybe—

"Looking for someone?"

I spun around.

Matt stood five feet away, duffel bag over his shoulder, hair wind-blown and sun-lightened from a week on the water. He looked tired and tan and wonderful, and my heart did that familiar flip it always did when I saw him.

"You're back," I said stupidly.

"I'm back." His expression was unreadable. "Got in late last night. Didn't want to bother you."

"You wouldn't have been bothering me."

"I know. But I needed time to think. To figure out what I wanted to say."

My stomach dropped. This was it. The moment where he'd tell me he'd decided I was too much trouble. That he couldn't trust me. That he was done waiting for me to figure out what I wanted.

"Okay," I said quietly. "I'm listening."

Matt glanced around at the beach filling with people, at Danny watching us with obvious interest, at Captain Ed pretending not to eavesdrop.

"Not here," he said. "Can we talk somewhere private? After shift?"

Seven more hours. Seven hours of not knowing. Seven hours of uncertainty.

"Yes," I said. "Of course. Our spot by the jetty? After shift ends?"

"Our spot," Matt repeated, something flickering in his expression. "Yeah. I'll meet you there."

Then he walked past me toward the lifeguard station, leaving me standing on the sand with my heart racing and no idea whether I was about to get my second chance or lose him forever.
