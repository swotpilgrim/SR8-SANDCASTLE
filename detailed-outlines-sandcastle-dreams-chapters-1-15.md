- During introductions, sixteen-year-old Matt Logan makes his infamous joke: "Hope the girl lifeguard can keep up" in front of everyone. Josie is humiliated and interprets it as condescension rather than nervous flirting. She responds with icy politeness masking fury.
- That first summer, Josie overcompensates by being the fastest, the best, the most vigilant—proving herself constantly. Matt tries to apologize early on, but she cuts him off. Their interactions become competitive battles. Other guards notice and start betting on their competitions.
- By summer's end, the rivalry is legendary. Matt is confused by her sustained anger but responds to her competitiveness in kind. The pattern is set—competition is their only mode of interaction.

- Josie's determination crystallizes—she's been second place twice, losing to Matt both times. This year she will win. The competition becomes her focus and purpose. Matt catches her eye during announcement; the challenge between them is clear without words.
- Crew reacts with excitement. Linda makes pointed comment about the Josie-Matt rivalry being the real competition, everyone else competing for third. Danny and other guards joke about the tension between them. Josie ignores the comments but feels the pressure.
- After meeting, Matt approaches Josie formally, extends his hand, says "may the best lifeguard win." Josie shakes it, feeling the competitive electricity. Their hands hold a moment too long before she pulls away.
- Evening at boarding house: Josie tells her mother Margaret about the competition. Margaret is supportive but gently suggests that maybe Josie cares so much because of Matt, not despite him. Josie insists it's about proving herself, period.

**Time:** Two-week period, various times of day

**Purpose:** Show escalating competition and proximity creating awareness, building romantic tension through physical interaction.

**Beats:**
- Josie commits to rigorous training schedule: running every morning before shift, practicing rescue techniques during off-hours, studying first aid manuals. She's obsessive and focused. Her mother worries about her intensity.
- Matt trains equally obsessively. They often end up training at the same times—whether by accident or unspoken agreement. Morning runs on the beach become informal races. Swimming to the jetty becomes competition. Every interaction is a challenge, but there's growing awareness beneath the rivalry.
- Physical proximity during training creates tension—practicing rescue carries requires touching, swimming side by side creates awareness of each other's bodies, competition makes them hyper-focused on each other. Josie notices details about Matt she doesn't want to notice: his endurance, his strength, the way he moves through water.
- Danny pulls Matt aside, tells him he's being an idiot. If he likes Josie, he should ask her to the upcoming beach bonfire instead of racing her constantly. Matt admits he doesn't know how to talk to Josie without competing—it's their only connection. Betty tells Josie the same thing: use words instead of swim times. Josie insists she has nothing to say to Matt Logan.

**Purpose:** Execute the dangerous rescue that forces Josie and Matt into partnership, demonstrating they're better together than apart.

**Beats:**

The child is being pulled rapidly away from shore, struggling and starting to panic. Josie immediately blows her whistle, signals Captain Ed with emergency code, and dives in without hesitation.
- Matt sees the situation from his stand simultaneously—the child is too far out for one guard to reach quickly and safely. He responds immediately, diving in and swimming hard to intercept. Both are fighting strong current, focused entirely on reaching the child.
- Josie reaches the child first by seconds. She grabs him but he's panicking, fighting her, making rescue harder. The riptide is incredibly strong, pulling them both. Josie struggles to keep the child's head above water while managing his terrified flailing. She realizes she can't get them both back to shore alone against this current.
- Matt arrives, positions himself strategically. Without words, they coordinate perfectly—Josie secures the child, Matt provides stability and strength to break the current pattern. They work in sync, swimming parallel to shore first to escape the riptide, then angling back toward beach. It's exhausting, dangerous, requiring perfect partnership.

- Josie and Matt collapse on the sand, exhausted and shaking from adrenaline crash. For the first time in three years, they look at each other without rivalry or defensiveness.

Matt breaks the silence: "You were incredible out there." Josie, surprised by the genuine compliment without sarcasm, responds: "So were you." First sincere compliments they've ever exchanged.
- Evening: Josie lies in bed replaying the rescue, specifically the moment when Matt arrived exactly when she needed him and they worked in perfect sync.

- Betty visits at lunch and immediately notices the change in atmosphere. She interrogates Josie about what happened. Josie tries to downplay it but admits the rescue changed something. Betty is delighted and pushes for details. Josie insists she still doesn't like Matt, but her protest sounds weak even to herself.
- Afternoon brings a quiet moment: a little girl approaches Josie's stand with a seashell. Her mother sent her to thank "the pretty lifeguard who saved the boy." The girl points to both Josie and Matt—"both of you." The child's innocent grouping of them as a team makes Josie smile and feel something warm.
- Josie glances at Matt and finds him already looking at her. He raises his eyebrows in question—what was that about? She shrugs, smiling slightly. He grins back. The moment is small but significant. For the first time, they're connecting without competition, and it feels both scary and right.
